**Title: A Proximate Bible: Interfacing the Book of Books**

Thesis: The book is undergoing a major media transition as print wanes in its dominance and the internet and mobile devices transform our relationship with books. With the entangled histories of bible and book--the bible is, after all, the book of books--this emerging media age and its transformation of reading practices forces us to imagine bible as something beyond the book. In my dissertation, I propose that bible, at its best, is an interface that affords proximity. I call bible an *interface* to stress that it is more than a container of content to be consumed. Bible is more than a book to be read, it is a space to be used. I suggest that bible can afford proximity in a Levinasian sense, such that bible as interface facilitates an approchableness (nearness) that resists mastery (distance).

**Introduction: Translating Book**

**Chapter 1: Interface – How does interface theory shape the way we understand reading practices?**

a. Defining Interface
a. Interface as Event
b. Interface as Space
d. Book as Interface
    i. Reader as User
    ii. Spaces Provoking Probabilistic Production
        * Production
        * Probabilistic
        * Provoke
e. Paving the Way
    i. John Miles Foley's Pathways Project
    ii. The Academic Book of the Future Project
         
**Chapter 2: Affording Proximity – Can interface design afford reading practices not governed by an original?**

a. Introducing Affordance
b. Affordance and Interface
c. Problem of Nearness and Distance
    i. what do we mean by nearness and distance here?
    i. Anxieties about emerging technologies (Carr, Turkle, etc.) 
    ii. Plato - writing and memory
    ii. Heidegger - distancelessness without nearness 
d. Responses to Nearness and Distance
    i. Introna/Drucker - ethics of nearness and distance in ICTs
    i. Levinasian Proximity
        * not about tech per se, but useful nonetheless
        * proximity as increase in both nearness and distance
        * nearness as approach and responsibility
        * distance as resistance to mastery
        * a proximate relationship: two resonances of the term
e. Affording Proximity: contact without grasp
    i. proximity beyond human-human interface? 
        * bible as face in Levinas
        * poetry as proximate
    ii. characteristics of proximate interface
        * nearness - other terms 
        * distance - other terms
        * anarchic - 
    ??ii. Combining McLuhan global village and silverstone proper distance
    iii. Proximate Interfaces
        * Walter Benjamin - Arcades Project and literary montage
        * Gospel manuscripts (David Parker)

**Chapter 3: Interfacing Bible as Book
argues that bible as book has hints of a proximate interface, but use seems to consolidate toward a distancelessness without nearness due to the affordances of closure and totality.
a. Codex as Mashup
    i. roll
    ii. wax tablet
    iii. codex as book  
        * I used to argue that book transcended codex, but perhaps not. Instead, bible needs to exceed book
        * affording non-linear access
b. Nearness and distance in bible as book - Trace affordance of proximity through interfaces
    ii. codex: Siniaticus
    iii. print: critical edition
    iv. kindle: The Holy Bible

**Chapter 4: Cracking the Binding: Bible as a Proximate Interface
a. Translating Sinaiticus
    i. return to codex sinaiticus project
    ii. digital access to manuscript with zoom and selection
    iii. entangled web interface
    iv. underlying ideologies - archic dispositions
b. Society of Biblical Literature GNT
    i. lacking covers and binding
    ii. OSIS and TEI - a value on interoperability?
    iii. What about intertext??
    iii. users and uses
c. Digital Bible Library
    i. ETEN and consolidating translations
    ii. Bible app
        * YouVersion is the name
        * 
    iii. Bible API
