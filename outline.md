**Title: Bible as Anarchic Interface**

Thesis: The book is undergoing a major media transition as print wanes in its dominance and the internet and mobile devices transform our reading habits. With the entangled histories of bible and book--the bible is, after all, the book of books--this emerging media age and its transformation of reading practices forces us to imagine bible as something beyond the book. In my dissertation, I propose that digital media create the possibility to engage bible as an *anarchic interface.* I call it an *interface* in order to stress that bible readers are more than just passive consumers of the words they read; they are also makers of meaning. I describe this interface as *anarchic* because the word’s etymology means both without a beginning and without a reign. Thus, an anarchic interface is a space of contact where meaning is produced without the reign of an original*. So much modern biblical interpretation has been about finding the original meaning in the text, but such a quest is at best elusive and at worst an illusion. An anarchic interface provides the opportunity to think of biblical interpretation entirely differently. Thinking of bible as an interface rather than simply as a container for content allows us to explore the way emerging technologies can translate and transform enduring traditions of bible reading into the coming media age in ways that transcend the usual media binaries of writer/reader, producer/consumer, form/content, right/wrong.

Interface is contact that demands distance. 
- interface as space of contact (space as process)
- proximity as contact that demands distance
-- a subjectivity from Levinas that can inform our theory of interface and 
-- proximity is nearness without mastery

Overall, I am arguing for ??
- chapter 1 argues that interface is a space that demands difference 
- chapter 2 argues that this notion of interface can be a space of and for proximity
- chapter 3 argues for bible as a proximate interface 
- chapter 4

A Proximate Bible: Interfacing the Book of Books

Maybe instead of affording anarchy, i am really talking about interfaces that afford proximity and maybe proximity is an extension of the provocation of probabilistic production introduced by Drucker. One of the characteristics of these proximate interfaces or maybe even dispositions shaped by these interfaces is anarchic textual processing, processing that is not ruled by an original text, a singular author, or a governing thesis. Not all interfaces afford proximity to same degree. Maybe in roll and codex, form facilitates nearness at risk of irradicating distance, but the content of bible resists this collapse and remains distant. As the conent of bible becomes over familiar OR becomes merely a prop for interface with bible as cultural icon, how can we conceptualize bible as still proximate? In emerging interfaces, do we see both form and content entangle to promote the affordance of proximity in new and interesting ways, or does new media just heighten our addiction to nearness? 

- chapter 1 Reading Interfaces: argues for interface as a relationship of user with environment that provokes probabilistic production and for book as interface 
- chapter 2 Affording Proximity: argues for proximity as a valuable affordance for interfaces such that interface affords both nearness (responsibility) and distance (resistance to mastery), care without consumption, contact without grasp. 
-- introduce affordance

- 
- chapter 4 Unbinding Non-Linear Access: argues that imagining bible beyond book, as a proximate interface can leverage some of the possibilities that were latent in book, but can be exploited more fully in interface beyond book once non-linear access comes unbound.
-- I used to argue here for book to cover (ha!) technologies from before codex and after, but here perhaps we reserve book for the technology that is a container for texts and begin to use the more open language of interface (of which book is one example) to talk about use of bible. 
-- same content in DBL can provide a proximate interface through API. Look closely at bible app here.
**Introduction: Translating Book**

**Chapter 1: Interface – How does interface theory shape the way we understand reading practices?**

a. Defining Interface
a. Interface as Event
b. Interface as Space
d. Book as Interface
    i. Reader as User
    ii. Spaces Provoking Probabilistic Production
        * Production
        * Probabilistic
        * Provoke
e. Paving the Way
    i. John Miles Foley's Pathways Project
    ii. The Academic Book of the Future Project
         
**Chapter 2: Affording Proximity – Can interface design afford reading practices not governed by an original?**

a. Introducing Affordance
b. Affordance and Interface
c. Interface and Proximity
- nearness and distance in technological advance
-- Heidegger 
-- introna
- nearness and distance in levinasian proximity
-- nearness as approach and responsibility
-- distance as resistance to mastery
-- an alternative to distancelessness without nearness in Heidegger 
D. affording proximity 
-- contact without grasp
-- anarchy
-- McLuhan global village silver stone proper distance

**chapter 3: Interfacing Bible as Book: affording Asymptote
argues that bible as book has the potential to offer a proximate interface, but use seems to consolidate toward a distancelessness without nearness. 
A. Proximity is not asymptote
B. Nearness and distance in bible as book - Trace affordance of proximity through interfaces
    i. roll: Isaiah roll from Qumran (could leave out and just have a few paragraphs leading up to codex reminding readers that bible has not always been codex)
    ii. codex: Siniaticus
    iii. print: critical edition
    iv. kindle: The Holy Bible

-- maybe connect affordance of nonlinear access to proximity in this analysis
-- make argument for why DBL is basically a new media translation of a codex in database form. 
-- use critical edition and master bible from UBS as examples of a distancelessness in interface, an archic sensibility 

**Chapter 4: Bible as Interface: Beyond the Book
-- return to codex sinaiticus project
-- SBL GNT and OSIS
-- DBL with Bible app and API

**Chapter 4: Materializing Anarchy – In what ways has bible operated as an anarchic interface?**

a. Evaluating Affordances
    i. N. Katherine Hayles and media specific analysis
    ii. Case Study - Codex and Non-Linear Access
b. Anarchy on the Page
    i. A Talmudic Page
    ii. Illuminated Bible Manuscripts
c. Anarchy Beyond the Page
    i. Bible Gateway - an internet bible interface
    ii. Twible - a bible version on Twitter
    iii. YouVersion's bible app - a mobile bible interface
