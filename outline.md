**Title: Bible as Anarchic Interface**

Thesis: The book is undergoing a major media transition as print wanes in its dominance and the internet and mobile devices transform our reading habits. With the entangled histories of bible and book--the bible is, after all, the book of books--this emerging media age and its transformation of reading practices forces us to imagine bible as something beyond the book. In my dissertation, I propose that digital media create the possibility to engage bible as an *anarchic interface.* I call it an *interface* in order to stress that bible readers are more than just passive consumers of the words they read; they are also makers of meaning. I describe this interface as *anarchic* because the word’s etymology means both without a beginning and without a reign. Thus, an anarchic interface is a space of contact where meaning is produced without the reign of an original*. So much modern biblical interpretation has been about finding the original meaning in the text, but such a quest is at best elusive and at worst an illusion. An anarchic interface provides the opportunity to think of biblical interpretation entirely differently. Thinking of bible as an interface rather than simply as a container for content allows us to explore the way emerging technologies can translate and transform enduring traditions of bible reading into the coming media age in ways that transcend the usual media binaries of writer/reader, producer/consumer, form/content, right/wrong.

Interface is contact that demands distance. 
- interface as space of contact (space as process)
- proximity as contact that demands distance
-- a subjectivity from Levinas that can inform our theory of interface and 
-- proximity is nearness without mastery

Overall, I am arguing for ??
- chapter 1 argues that interface is a space that demands difference 
- chapter 2 argues that this notion of interface can be a space of and for proximity
- chapter 3 argues for bible as a proximate interface 
- chapter 4
