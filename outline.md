**Title: A Proximate Bible: Interfacing the Book of Books**

Thesis: The book is undergoing a major media transition as print wanes in its dominance and the internet and mobile devices transform our relationship with books. With the entangled histories of bible and book--the bible is, after all, the book of books--this emerging media age and its transformation of reading practices forces us to imagine bible as something beyond the book. In my dissertation, I propose that bible, at its best, is an interface that affords proximity. I call bible an *interface* to stress that it is irreducible to the content it contains. Bible is more than a book to be read, it is a space to be used. Based on the notion of proximity in the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, I argue for proximity as a relationship between user and platform that provides for both nearness as a realtionship of responsibility and distance as a resistance to mastery. Capitalizing on the multiple nuances of the word proximate, I will show that bible as book and beyond can offer a close encounter that is always ap-proximate. This entanglement of nearness and distance in proximity provides bible an ongoing robust interface amidst the prevalent anxieties regarding the emergence of new media technologies. Translating and expanding this affordance of proximity into new media interfaces will offer bible a mechanism to remain connected to its rich traditon as interface as it comes unbound from the book. 

**Introduction: Translating Book**
a. Introduce Affordances
    i. relationship of terms, not property of an object

**Chapter 1: Interface **
Interface, a relationship between user and platform, provides a way to conceptualize bible as irreducible to the content it contains.

a. Defining Interface
a. Interface as Event
b. Interface as Space
d. Book as Interface
    i. Reader as User
    ii. Spaces Provoking Probabilistic Production
        * Production
        * Probabilistic
        * Provoke
e. Paving the Way
    i. John Miles Foley's Pathways Project
    ii. The Academic Book of the Future Project
         
**Chapter 2: Affording Proximity **
Proximity is a valuable affordance that helps negotiate the familiar anxiety of changing notions of nearness and distance as new technologies emerge. 

c. Problem of Nearness and Distance
    i. what do we mean by nearness and distance here?
    i. Anxieties about emerging technologies (Carr, Turkle, etc.) 
    ii. Plato - writing and memory
    ii. Heidegger - distancelessness without nearness 
d. Responses to Nearness and Distance
    i. Introna/Drucker - ethics of nearness and distance in ICTs
    i. Levinasian Proximity
        * not about tech per se, but useful nonetheless
        * proximity as increase in both nearness and distance
        * nearness as approach and responsibility
        * distance as resistance to mastery
        * a proximate relationship: two resonances of the term
e. Affording Proximity: contact without grasp
    i. proximity beyond human-human interface? 
        * bible as face in Levinas
        * poetry as proximate
    ii. characteristics of proximate interface
        * nearness - other terms 
        * distance - other terms
        * anarchic - 
    iii. Examples of Proximate Interfaces
        * Walter Benjamin - Arcades Project and literary montage
        * Gospel manuscripts (David Parker)

**Chapter 3: Interfacing Bible as Book **
Bible as book has the potential to provide a proximate interface. 

a. Codex as Mashup
    i. roll
    ii. wax tablet
    iii. codex as book  
        * I used to argue that book transcended codex, but perhaps not. Instead, bible needs to exceed book
        * affording non-linear access
b. Nearness and distance in bible as book - Trace affordance of proximity through interfaces
    ii. manuscript: Siniaticus
    iii. print: critical edition
    iv. kindle: The Holy Bible

**Chapter 4: Cracking the Binding: Bible as a Proximate Interface **
The affordance of proximity can help bible remain a robust interface even as book wanes in its dominance.

a. Translating Sinaiticus
    i. return to codex sinaiticus project
    ii. digital access to manuscript with zoom and selection
    iii. entangled web interface
    iv. underlying ideologies - archic dispositions
b. Society of Biblical Literature GNT
    i. lacking covers and binding
    ii. OSIS and TEI - a value on interoperability?
    iii. What about intertext??
    iii. users and uses
c. Digital Bible Library
    i. ETEN and consolidating translations
    ii. Bible app
        * YouVersion is the name
        * 
    iii. Bible API
