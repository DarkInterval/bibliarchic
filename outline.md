**Title: Bible as Anarchic Interface**

Thesis: The book is undergoing a major media transition as print wanes in its dominance and the internet and mobile devices transform our reading habits. With the entangled histories of bible and book--the bible is, after all, the book of books--this emerging media age and its transformation of reading practices forces us to imagine bible as something beyond the book. In my dissertation, I propose that digital media create the possibility to engage bible as an *anarchic interface.* I call it an *interface* in order to stress that bible readers are more than just passive consumers of the words they read; they are also makers of meaning. I describe this interface as *anarchic* because the word’s etymology means both without a beginning and without a reign. Thus, an anarchic interface is a space of contact where meaning is produced without the reign of an original*. So much modern biblical interpretation has been about finding the original meaning in the text, but such a quest is at best elusive and at worst an illusion. An anarchic interface provides the opportunity to think of biblical interpretation entirely differently. Thinking of bible as an interface rather than simply as a container for content allows us to explore the way emerging technologies can translate and transform enduring traditions of bible reading into the coming media age in ways that transcend the usual media binaries of writer/reader, producer/consumer, form/content, right/wrong.

Interface is contact that demands distance. 
- interface as space of contact (space as process)
- proximity as contact that demands distance
-- a subjectivity from Levinas that can inform our theory of interface and 
-- proximity is nearness without mastery

Overall, I am arguing for ??
- chapter 1 argues that interface is a space that demands difference 
- chapter 2 argues that this notion of interface can be a space of and for proximity
- chapter 3 argues for bible as a proximate interface 
- chapter 4

A Proximate Bible: Interfacing the Book of Books

Maybe instead of affording anarchy, i am really talking about interfaces that afford proximity and maybe proximity is an extension of the provocation of probabilistic production introduced by Drucker. One of the characteristics of these proximate interfaces or maybe even dispositions shaped by these interfaces is anarchic textual processing, processing that is not ruled by an original text, a singular author, or a governing thesis. Not all interfaces afford proximity to same degree. Maybe in roll and codex, form facilitates nearness at risk of irradicating distance, but the content of bible resists this collapse and remains distant. As the conent of bible becomes over familiar OR becomes merely a prop for interface with bible as cultural icon, how can we conceptualize bible as still proximate? In emerging interfaces, do we see both form and content entangle to promote the affordance of proximity in new and interesting ways, or does new media just heighten our addiction to nearness? 

- chapter 1 Reading Interfaces: argues for interface as a relationship of user with environment that provokes probabilistic production and for book as interface 
- chapter 2 Affording Proximity: argues for proximity as a valuable affordance for interfaces such that interface affords both nearness (responsibility) and distance (resistance to mastery), care without consumption, contact without grasp. 
-- introduce affordance

- 
- chapter 4 Unbinding Non-Linear Access: argues that imagining bible beyond book, as a proximate interface can leverage some of the possibilities that were latent in book, but can be exploited more fully in interface beyond book once non-linear access comes unbound.
-- I used to argue here for book to cover (ha!) technologies from before codex and after, but here perhaps we reserve book for the technology that is a container for texts and begin to use the more open language of interface (of which book is one example) to talk about use of bible. 
-- same content in DBL can provide a proximate interface through API. Look closely at bible app here.
**Introduction: Translating Book**

**Chapter 1: Interface – How does interface theory shape the way we understand reading practices?**

a. Defining Interface
a. Interface as Event
b. Interface as Space
d. Book as Interface
    i. Reader as User
    ii. Spaces Provoking Probabilistic Production
        * Production
        * Probabilistic
        * Provoke
e. Paving the Way
    i. John Miles Foley's Pathways Project
    ii. The Academic Book of the Future Project
         
**Chapter 2: Affording Proximity – Can interface design afford reading practices not governed by an original?**

a. Introducing Affordance
b. Affordance and Interface
c. Problem of Nearness and Distance
    i. what do we mean by nearness and distance here?
    i. Anxieties about emerging technologies (Carr, Turkle, etc.) 
    ii. Plato - writing and memory
    ii. Heidegger - distancelessness without nearness 
d. Responses to Nearness and Distance
    i. Introna/Drucker - ethics of nearness and distance in ICTs
    i. Levinasian Proximity
        * not about tech per se, but useful nonetheless
        * proximity as increase in both nearness and distance
        * nearness as approach and responsibility
        * distance as resistance to mastery
        * a proximate relationship: two resonances of the term
e. Affording Proximity: contact without grasp
    i. proximity beyond human-human interface? 
        * bible as face in Levinas
        * poetry as proximate
    ii. characteristics of proximate interface
        * nearness - other terms 
        * distance - other terms
        * anarchic - 
    ??ii. Combining McLuhan global village and silverstone proper distance
    iii. Proximate Interfaces
        * Walter Benjamin - Arcades Project and literary montage
        * Gospel manuscripts (David Parker)

**Chapter 3: Interfacing Bible as Book: Binding Proximity
argues that bible as book has hints of a proximate interface, but use seems to consolidate toward a distancelessness without nearness due to the affordances of closure and totality.
a. Codex as Mashup
    i. roll
    ii. wax tablet
    iii. codex as book  
        * I used to argue that book transcended codex, but perhaps not. Instead, bible needs to exceed book
        * affording non-linear access
b. Nearness and distance in bible as book - Trace affordance of proximity through interfaces
    ii. codex: Siniaticus
    iii. print: critical edition
    iv. kindle: The Holy Bible

**Chapter 4: Cracking the Binding: Bible as a Proximate Interface
a. Translating Sinaiticus
    i. return to codex sinaiticus project
    ii. digital access to manuscript with zoom and selection
    iii. entangled web interface
    iv. underlying ideologies - archic dispositions
b. Society of Biblical Literature GNT
    i. lacking covers and binding
    ii. OSIS and TEI - a value on interoperability?
    iii. What about intertext??
    iii. users and uses
c. Digital Bible Library
    i. ETEN and consolidating translations
    ii. Bible app
        * YouVersion is the name
        * 
    iii. Bible API
