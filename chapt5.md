# Chapter 5: Proliferation of Interfaces

One bible interface that begins to move in the direction of what Peter Robinson was calling for in the Codex Sinaiticus Project is a recently emerging project called the Digital Bible Library (DBL). There are three reasons why I am considering DBL a bible interface even though it is technically a repository of bible interfaces. First, DBL provides the data backend for one of the most widely used bible interfaces in the world, YouVersion's Bible app. Second, as Robinson looked toward, DBL provides a platform for others to create any number of bible interfaces using the artifacts and data available in the library. Third, in its aim to become the definitive, comprehensive, and authoritative source for all things bible, DBL performs the cultural iconicity of bible as defined by Timothy Beal.^[Beal, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, Kindle location 66-74.] Beal also helpfully reminds us that bible has always been a kind of library, gathering a cacophony of voices and writings together from different times and places, such that DBL could even be viewed as a bible of bibles.^[Beal, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, Kindle location 2006.] While the licensing and distribution aspects of DBL still operate in a paradigm primarily governed by the ideologies of book production, the interfaces enabled by the database that is DBL are pushing bible beyond its long history of bondage to the page. After an introduction to the technological and cultural situatedness of DBL, I will look closely at two interfaces that interface with DBL, the incredibly successful and popular mobile bible app from YouVersion and the American Bible Society's BibleSearch API. In different ways, these two bible interfaces provide a definitive move beyond the book for bible, while continuing to afford proximity through high surface area, collaborative capacities, and anarchic tendencies.

### The Bible of Bibles ###

At its simplest, The Digital Bible Library (DBL) operates as a giant storage container that can hold any item related to bible. At the time of their public April 2017 Content Update, DBL contained 1508 text entries in 1145 unique languages and 444 audio entries in 374 unique languages.^[https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/2017/04/01/april-2017-content-update/ accessed on April 25, 2017.] The tracking of the number of unique languages involved in this content highlights the mission and vision of DBL and points toward one of the critical founding partners. The mission and vision of DBL deserves full mention here:

> The vision for The Digital Bible Library™ is to contain digital Scripture, in every language spoken on earth by the year 2033. Its mission is to gather, validate, and safeguard Scripture translation content in a standardized digital format, and to empower partners to reach people from every tribe, in every nation, with the power of God’s Word in their heart language by providing authorized and licensed access to the library content.^[https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/about/ access on April 25, 2017.]

The governing impulse behind this bible repository is to make the content of the bible, "Scripture translation content," available in "every language spoken on earth." The mention of every tribe in every nation here signals the deep involvement in DBL of the alliance of bible translation agencies known as "Every Tribe Every Nation" (ETEN). DBL is the primary project funded and managed by ETEN and a quick glance at the homepage of their website shows how ETEN locates DBL in the trajectory of technological innovation begun by Gutenberg.^[http://www.everytribeeverynation.org/ accessed on April 25, 2017.] The fact that DBL is funded and managed primarily by an aggregation of bible translation agencies helps explain why the content of this library is primarily focused on bible translations, which seems to come with a bias toward bible as reducible to linguistic content. For all of the language of validation, safeguarding, and authorizing in the DBL mission and vision statement, there seems to be little awareness of the impact of interface on the relationship between users and content. While DBL provides a mechanism for validation and authorization of the linguistic content of a bible, it promises very little interest in controlling the interfaces built around this content except through policing which institutions can hold a DBL Library Card. 

The technical aspects of DBL are managed by the Institute for Computer Assisted Publishing (ICAP).^[ICAP is a part of the United Bible Societies, an alliance of National Bible Societies all over the world that manage and produce bible translation projects.] ICAP was instrumental in developing ParaTEext,^[http://paratext.org/ access on April 25, 2017.] the software used by bible translation projects globally. Since it is so heavily involved in the translation production process already, ParaTExt has naturally become the primary mechanism for getting items into DBL. In this sense, ParaTExt is one of the many interfaces that participate in DBL.^[Technically, DBL is considered one part of a larger digital scripture development ecosystem that includes ParaTExt and other tools. See https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/about/ visited on April 25, 2017, for more details on this ecosystem approach.] On a closer look at the workflow and data structure of DBL, it is clear that the foundational unit for the datastore is the textual content of a particular translation, which is no surprise given the translation context from which this whole project arose.^[For a helpful look at the overall workflow of DBL and where it is located in the process of bible production and dissemination, see the diagram at http://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/static/docs/about.html#complete-workflow, accessed on April 25, 2017.] The data stored in DBL comes in two forms, an archive bundle and a release bundle. The archive bundle is simply a highly redundant backup of the project files used to produce a given bible text so that the project can be reconstituted if lost. The release bundle is the data that becomes part of the interfaces we will discuss below and is the primary bible interface of DBL. An example of this DBL bible interface looks like this,

~~~
<para style="p"> ... Large crowds followed him from Galilee and the Ten Towns, from Jerusalem, Judea,
  and the land on the other side of the Jordan.</para>
<chapter number="5" style="c" />
<para style="s">The Sermon on the Mount</para>
<para style="p">
  <verse number="1" style="v" />Jesus saw the crowds and went up a hill, where he sat down.
  His disciples gathered around him, <verse number="2" style="v" />and he began to teach them:</para>
~~~

Like we saw with the transcription data of the Codex Sinaiticus web bible interface, this release bundle data in DBL is encoded in XML (Extensible Markup Language). The XML used by DBL is a specialized encoding standard designed specifically for digitizing biblical texts called Unified Scripture XML (USX).^[For detailed description and documentation of the USX 2.5 standard, see http://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/static/docs/usx/index.html, accessed on April 25, 2017.] This particular USX standard holds together the versification needs of bible data and continues to contain encoding for structural and style definitions that might be useful for producing print versions of the digitized text. Given ICAP's history of making software to assist in print production of bibles and the continued high demand for print bibles in the world, this print based encoding makes sense. This is another example of new interfaces continuing on the characteristics of their predecessors.^[The Codex Sinaiticus Project transcription XML had to include a great deal of positional data in the encoding to support the linking between the image and the transcription and the special formatting of the transcription in columnar form on the page.] The smallest textual unit of this USX encoding is the biblical verse, not the word like we saw in the Codex Sinaiticus Project transcription XML.^[The XML of the SBLGNT also encodes all the way to the word level.] The way the XML of a DBL bible works is through a hierarchical structure of tagged entities with attributes and content. In the example above, the tags are designated by the brackets "<>," which define "para," "chapter," and "verse" tags in this particular selection. All tags in XML have some form of opening and closing. The simplest form of this open/close syntax is demonstrated by the <para> tags in this sample. You will notice that each <para> tag in the code is followed somewhere later in the code by a </para> tag, these are the opening and the closing of a paragraph, respectively. Everything contained between these tags is a part of that paragraph, which can include text and verse tags, etc.  

With verse as the smallest unit, the DBL XML interface is lower surface area than it could be by encoding at smaller intervals, such as the word or the character. Taken on its own, the USX standard also continues to be governed by print paradigms of publishing bibles, with the inclusion of tags for items such as paragraphs and sidebars. Yet, one of the unique characteristics of DBL as a bible interface is that DBL is an interface for other interfaces. The release bundle XML interface I have just described is intended for a machine to read, not a person. So, even though this print paradigm encoding is present in the interface, it can be ignored by the user, such as the YouVersion bible app, if desired. Yet, it is important to have a detailed sense of the assumptions built into the data shaping the interfaces we will discuss next, even if DBL has afforded rather high collaborative capacities in its bible interface. 

DBL does not look at all like a bible, it has no covers and nothing resembling pages, even at the XML level.^[Some REST APIs like that used by DBL do have a structure of pagination that returns only a certain number of data elements per request.] The content of what is typically considered bible is in DBL, in fact in over a thousand different languages including audio and text for many of these languages. Yet, given our discussion of interface as irreducible to content, the fact that DBL contains the texts usually held between the covers of a bound codex called bible is not enough to deem it bible. Does this bible interface afford proximity? Can we require this of bible interfaces? If so, are there bibles as we have known them that do not meet this requirement? It is critical to keep in mind the 

DBL complicates our discussion of interface because the use of this bible interface is predominantly in the direction of producing more bible interfaces. I can read this XML bible interface, but it is not pleasant and there are many better interfaces for reading bible.  



### Bible Goes Mobile ###

One of the main users of the DBL bible interface is the incredibly popular bible interface produced by Life.Church called YouVersion. It's utter dominance in the mobile bible market has allowed the app to take on the more generic name of simply "The Bible App."" In the app store on Apple's iOS, the name of the app is simply "Bible" and their own language in the description of the app simply refers to it as The Bible App.^[The web address for the bible app is http://www.bible.com.] Although this bible interface most definitely pushes far beyond the book in many ways, the icon for The Bible App is a cartoon representation of a leather bound print codex with a red silk bookmark and the title "Holy Bible" in gold letters on the cover. The iconicity of bible as book still has a role to play even in these emerging interfaces that seem to crack its binding. 

-- audio adds surface area, but perhaps decreases collaborative capacities?
-- reading plans??
-- email verse of day seems low surface area and low collaborative capacity.

The primary reading interface does not even require an account and offers a very simple and accessible set of features. 

* I wonder if the reading plans of YouVersion are actually a decreased surface area in comparison to the high surface area of participation in a roll, where user has to roll the book to locate the pertinent passage for a particular reading. If an interface simply tweets or emails a user with a passage, it seems that this could actually be a lack of surface area on the participation end, even if the several channels of interaction with the text could be an increase of surface area. It is critical that surface area increase involvement, not just consumption of content and perhaps this is the difference here?
