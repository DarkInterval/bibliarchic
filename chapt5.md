# Chapter 5: Proliferation of Interfaces

One bible interface that begins to move in the direction of what Peter Robinson was calling for in the Codex Sinaiticus Project is a recently emerging project called the Digital Bible Library (DBL). There are three reasons why I am considering DBL a bible interface even though it is technically a repository of bible interfaces. First, DBL provides the data backend for one of the most widely used bible interfaces in the world, YouVersion's Bible app. Second, as Robinson looked toward, DBL provides a platform for others to create any number of bible interfaces using the artifacts and data available in the library. Third, in its aim to become the definitive, comprehensive, and authoritative source for all things bible, DBL performs the cultural iconicity of bible as defined by Timothy Beal.^[Beal, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, Kindle location 66-74.] Beal also helpfully reminds us that bible has always been a kind of library, gathering a cacophony of voices and writings together from different times and places, such that DBL could even be viewed as a bible of bibles.^[Beal, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, Kindle location 2006.] While the licensing and distribution aspects of DBL still operate in a paradigm primarily governed by the ideologies of book production, the interfaces enabled by the database that is DBL are pushing bible beyond its long history of bondage to the page. After an introduction to the technological and cultural situatedness of DBL, I will look closely at two interfaces that interface with DBL, the incredibly successful and popular mobile bible app from YouVersion and the American Bible Society's BibleSearch API. In different ways, these two bible interfaces provide a definitive move beyond the book for bible, while continuing to afford proximity through high surface area, collaborative capacities, and anarchic tendencies.

### The Bible of Bibles ###

At its simplest, The Digital Bible Library (DBL) operates as a giant storage container that can hold any item related to bible. At the time of their public April 2017 Content Update, DBL contained 1508 text entries in 1145 unique languages and 444 audio entries in 374 unique languages.^[https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/2017/04/01/april-2017-content-update/ accessed on April 25, 2017.] The tracking of the number of unique languages involved in this content highlights the mission and vision of DBL and points toward one of the critical founding partners. The mission and vision of DBL deserves full mention here:

> The vision for The Digital Bible Library™ is to contain digital Scripture, in every language spoken on earth by the year 2033. Its mission is to gather, validate, and safeguard Scripture translation content in a standardized digital format, and to empower partners to reach people from every tribe, in every nation, with the power of God’s Word in their heart language by providing authorized and licensed access to the library content.^[https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/about/ access on April 25, 2017.]

The governing impulse behind this bible repository is to make the content of the bible, "Scripture translation content," available in "every language spoken on earth." The mention of every tribe in every nation here signals the deep involvement in DBL of the alliance of bible translation agencies known as "Every Tribe Every Nation" (ETEN). DBL is the primary project funded and managed by ETEN and a quick glance at the homepage of their website shows how ETEN locates DBL in the trajectory of technological innovation begun by Gutenberg.^[http://www.everytribeeverynation.org/ accessed on April 25, 2017.] The fact that DBL is funded and managed primarily by an aggregation of bible translation agencies helps explain why the content of this library is primarily focused on bible translations, which seems to come with a bias toward bible as reducible to linguistic content. For all of the language of validation, safeguarding, and authorizing in the DBL mission and vision statement, there seems to be little awareness of the impact of interface on the relationship between users and content. While DBL provides a mechanism for validation and authorization of the linguistic content of a bible, it promises very little interest in controlling the interfaces built around this content except through policing which institutions can hold a DBL Library Card. 

The technical aspects of DBL are managed by the Institute for Computer Assisted Publishing (ICAP).^[ICAP is a part of the United Bible Societies, an alliance of National Bible Societies all over the world that manage and produce bible translation projects.] ICAP was instrumental in developing ParaTEext,^[http://paratext.org/ access on April 25, 2017.] the software used by bible translation projects globally. Since it is so heavily involved in the translation production process already, ParaTExt has naturally become the primary mechanism for getting items into DBL. In this sense, ParaTExt is one of the many interfaces that participate in DBL.^[Technically, DBL is considered one part of a larger digital scripture development ecosystem that includes ParaTExt and other tools. See https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/about/ visited on April 25, 2017, for more details on this ecosystem approach.] On a closer look at the workflow and data structure of DBL, it is clear that the foundational unit for the datastore is the textual content of a particular translation, which is no surprise given the translation context from which this whole project arose.^[For a helpful look at the overall workflow of DBL and where it is located in the process of bible production and dissemination, see the diagram at http://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/static/docs/about.html#complete-workflow, accessed on April 25, 2017.] The data stored in DBL comes in two forms, an archive bundle and a release bundle. The archive bundle is simply a highly redundant backup of the project files used to produce a given bible text so that the project can be reconstituted if lost. The release bundle is the data that becomes part of the interfaces we will discuss below and is the primary bible interface of DBL. An example of this DBL bible interface looks like this,

~~~
<para style="p"> ... Large crowds followed him from Galilee and the Ten Towns, from Jerusalem, Judea,
  and the land on the other side of the Jordan.</para>
<chapter number="5" style="c" />
<para style="s">The Sermon on the Mount</para>
<para style="p">
  <verse number="1" style="v" />Jesus saw the crowds and went up a hill, where he sat down.
  His disciples gathered around him, <verse number="2" style="v" />and he began to teach them:</para>
~~~

Like we saw with the transcription data of the Codex Sinaiticus web bible interface, this release bundle data in DBL is encoded in XML (Extensible Markup Language). In syntax, XML is similar to HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the more familiar markup standard that web browsers read to present web pages to a user. Two important differences between HTML and XML are 1) HTML is used to display data, while XML is used to describe data and 2) HTML tags are fixed and standard, while XML tags are flexible and defined as they are used. Although any XML document can define its own structure and tags, there are often advantages to using a standard encoding practice to allow for predictable processing across multiple documents. The XML used by DBL is a specialized encoding standard designed specifically for digitizing biblical texts called Unified Scripture XML (USX).^[For detailed description and documentation of the USX 2.5 standard, see http://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/static/docs/usx/index.html, accessed on April 25, 2017.] This particular USX standard holds together the versification needs of bible data and continues to contain encoding for structural and style definitions that might be useful for producing print versions of the digitized text. Given ICAP's history of making software to assist in print production of bibles and the continued high demand for print bibles in the world, this print based encoding makes sense. This is another example of new interfaces continuing on the characteristics of their predecessors.^[The Codex Sinaiticus Project transcription XML had to include a great deal of positional data in the encoding to support the linking between the image and the transcription and the special formatting of the transcription in columnar form on the page.] The smallest textual unit of this USX encoding is the biblical verse, not the word like we saw in the Codex Sinaiticus Project transcription XML.^[The XML of the SBLGNT also encodes all the way to the word level.] 

The way the XML of a DBL bible works is through a hierarchical structure of tagged entities with attributes and content. In the example above, the tags are designated by the brackets "<>," which define "para," "chapter," and "verse" tags in this particular selection. As I mentioned above, XML allows for any tag to be used, so the naming and structuring of tags can tell us something about the assumptions and values of an interface. All tags in XML have some form of opening and closing. The simplest form of this open/close syntax is demonstrated by the \<para\> tags in this sample. You will notice that each \<para\> tag in the code is followed somewhere later in the code by a \</para\> tag, these are the opening and the closing of a paragraph, respectively, with the forward slash indicating a closure.^[This open and close syntax is identical to HTML.] Everything contained between these tags is a part of that paragraph element, which can include text and verse tags, etc. Given the typical difference between XML and HTML I mentioned above, where HTML deals with displaying data and XML with describing data, the presence of \<para\> tags in this DBL XML is surprising. Chapter and verse tags make sense, since these would be describing and labeling the kind of data in the interface. A paragraph tag has more to do with display than with type of data. In fact, one of the core tags used in most HTML standards is a paragraph tag, \<p\> instead of \</para\>. Yet, in the DBL bible interface, paragraph operates as a data descriptor at the same level in the hierarchy as book and chapter elements. The prominence of the paragraph element in the XML of the DBL bible interface suggests that though this interface has made a move away from the dominance of the page as the primary unit of encounter for a user, the structural and stylistic demands of organizing text on a page remain a part of the dataset that constitutes bible. 

If we look at the style attribute values of the paragraph element in this USX standard used by DBL, we can see the demands of print production of bibles at work.^[For a detailed description of all of the available style attributes in the \<para\> element, see https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/static/docs/usx/parastyles.html.] In XML, attributes are key-value pairs that indicate specific details about a given element defined by a tag to offer additional data to describe this element. In the example above, each \<para\> element has a style attribute indicated by the keyword "style" inside the brackets that define the tag followed by an equals sign and a value, such as \<para style="p"\>. A given tag can have multiple attributes that offer different kinds of additional information about the element. For example, the verse and chapter tags in our sample have both a number attribute and a style attribute. The style attribute in the paragraph elements of DBL XML functions much like the style definitions in a word processor like Microsoft Word. In Word, a user can select a style of "Heading 1" or "Quote" or "Footnote" for a particular selection of text in the document and Word will apply a predefined set of formatting rules to that unit of text, such as font size, emphasis, and distance from the margins, to name a few. The predefined set of possible values for the style attribute of the paragraph element in the XML of DBL provide a mechanism of uniform formating for like elements within a bible, much like the heading and quote styles found in Microsoft Word. A \<para\> style attribute value of "p" indicates a normal paragraph, which signals that no additional formatting is needed for the content of that paragraph element. In our sample XML, we have one paragraph element with style="s", indicating a section heading, which can then be treated differently than a normal paragraph when displayed.^[For examples of the use of the section heading style attribute, see https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/static/docs/usx/parastyles.html#usx-parastyle-s.] The ubiquity of this style attribute in the DBL bible interface indicates a continued investment in the control and standardization of the display of text on a page. The release bundle that comprises the XML that is the interface with bible in DBL contains a styles.xml file that contains explicit definitions for each of the possible values of the style attribute. Users of this DBL bible interface can elect to adjust these style definitions, choosing a particular font to render normal paragraphs or a different color to emphasize section headings. Yet, the structure of these elements, the definition of headings and the beginning and ending of paragraphs is already cooked into the bible interface through these \<para\> elements and their style attributes. Due to the involvement of DBL in the production of other bible interfaces in both print and digital forms, the XML encoding of DBL does the work of what is typically divided between XML and HTML, describing the data of these bibles and establishing the appropriate parameters for displaying this data. On one hand, including such explicit encoding for display in the XML of DBL bibles seems to continue to pay homage, perhaps anachronistically or unnecessarily, to the role of the book in defining bible as interface. On the other hand, this detailed attention to stylistic and structural elements in the XML of DBL reinforces that bible as interface continues to exceed simply the content a bible contains. 

In terms of data description elements, the smallest unit in USX, the DBL XML standard, is the verse. There are a few smaller elements in the USX hierarchy, such as \<char\>, \<cell\>, and \<optbreak\>, but as I noted with the \<para\> tag, these elements are focused on the display of data, not on its description.^[The character element allows for stylistic formating at smaller textual intervals than a while paragraph element. The cell element describes the content and attributes of a single cell in a tabular structure. The optbreak element simply indicates the position of an optional line break in section of text.] A verse element is a child of the paragraph element and unlike the paragraph element, which includes explicit open and close tags, the verse element marks only the opening of a verse, not its end.^[Technically, a verse element can be a child of the \<para\>, \<row\>, or \<cell\> elements, but row and cell elements are only used for tabular display of verses.] Instead of including a \</verse\> tag at the end of each verse, the verse element opens and closes in the same tag, such that technically, the words of the verse are not the content of the verse element, the verse element is empty. The way a verse element indicates open and close in a single tag is to include the forward slash character at the end of the open tag, just before the close bracket. So, instead of \<verse\>...\</verse\>, we have \<verse ... /\>. In the strictest terms, the verse element has no content, since there is no data in between an open and close tag. A verse element simple has attributes such as number, style, and alternative verse numberings. Each verse tag includes at least a style and a number attribute, with "v" for verse as the only acceptable value for the style attribute and number having a value that indicates the sequential number of the verse within the chapter of which it is a part.^[Since there is only one acceptable value for the style attribute of the verse element, this attribute is entirely redundant and unnecessary, since the tag name already identifies the element uniquely as a verse. The style attribute is also redundant in the chapter element, which has exactly the same structure as the verse element, but indicates the beginning of a chapter, not a verse, and the chapter element is not a child of the paragraph element.] Since verse elements are technically empty and they are child elements of the paragraph element in the USX hierarchy, the words of verses are functionally content of a paragraph, with the verse element simply indicating where a verse number should be inserted in the paragraph element. Though a subtle point, again we see the structure of text on a page emerge as the governing architecture in USX, with paragraphs containing verses and verses being empty.^[When processing these XML files with a language such as python, the text of a given verse is more precisely identified as a "tail" of the verse element. In the Element class of the etree module of the xml python library, a tail in XML is content that follows a close tag. Since each verse tag in USX closes in the open tag and is then followed by the words of the verse, these words are part of the tail of the verse element. Because the verse element is a child of the paragraph element, even its tails belong to the paragraph element, which is why I have articulated the words of verses here as content of paragraphs.] With verse as the smallest unit of data description in the XML of DBL and with the content of verses essentially functioning as content of paragraphs due to the hierarchical structure of the elements in USX, the DBL bible interface is lower surface area than it could be by encoding at smaller intervals, such as the word or the character. We saw a similar tendency toward lower surface area in the XML of the transcription of the Codex Sinaiticus web interface, where the high surface area character by character processing demanded by *scripta continua* was lowered by the word by word encoding of the transcription. In both cases, the lower surface area of the XML provides for more efficient processing on the user end. If DBL XML encoded at the word or character level, then users of the interface (other interfaces such as a mobile bible study application in this case) would have to build in mechanisms for handling these additional surfaces, which could slow down or impede the ability of a user to work through this XML to render the text in an interface. 

This discussion of the surface area of the XML of DBL points out one of the unique characteristics of DBL as a bible interface, that DBL is an interface for other interfaces. The release bundle XML interface I have just described is intended for a machine to read, not a person, in order to produce another bible interface such as a print edition, a kindle bible, or a web interface that affords access to several translations at once. Even though the print paradigm encoding governed by the paragraph is present in the DBL interface, it can be ignored or decentered by a user, such as the YouVersion bible app or the Bible Search web interface, if desired. There are explicit suggestions and demands for how a DBL bible is to be used in the construction of a new interface, through the structure of the XML, the style definitions, and the licensing requirements contained in the release bundle. Yet, the attempted persuasive language of "should" used by the documentation for the elements of the DBL XML standard highlights both some of the collaborative capacities and the potential anarchic tendencies of this DBL bible interface.^[For an example of this persuasive language, see the additional notes alongside the samples provided for the verse element at https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/static/docs/usx/elements.html#samples.] Because the XML of DBL does not contain explicit HTML code or complete print layout definitions, the DBL bible interface demands a user to participate in the construction of the bible, since the DBL bible interface exists only to enable the production of more bible interfaces. This complicated relationship between users and an interface that seeds the development of new interfaces also points to the inability of the DBL XML to govern entirely how users will participate in constructing the next layer of interface, an anarchic tendency of sorts. As we have seen with a close look at the XML of DBL bibles, DBL can not be reduced to simply a data or content source for bible interfaces, it is an interface of its own. Yet, the vast collaborative capacities afforded by the myriad ways to translate DBL XML into different media interfaces, ignoring or differently interpreting some of the structural elements of the DBL interface, resists the ability of DBL to dictate or determine use of this bible interface. One of the ways in which DBL attempts to mitigate these anarchic tendencies of its bible interface is to closely control who can be a library card holder, hence to have a high level of control over users of the interface. The DBL bible interface is decidedly not public. A user, which in this case is an institution such as American Bible Society or YouVersion, has to be a library card holder (LCH) in the DBL, which they also refer to as publishers, and abide by the licensing requirements of a given bible in order to have the ability to download and use a release bundle from DBL. The criteria for becoming a LCH include 

> **Reputable Standing** – Only reputable organizations will be considered for participation in the DBL. A reputable organization is one that follows the historic tenets of Christianity...
**Cooperation** – While we don’t expect all partners to hold to similar confessional practices or standards, we do expect them all to be able to operate cordially and constructively with all ETEN members, including the inter-confessional ones. Applying organizations should not have any outstanding conflicts with any current ETEN partners or other Library Card Holders.^[For a full list of the criteria for being an LCH in DBL, see the LCH criteria accordion menu of the Library Card Holder tab on the ZGet Involved page of the DBL website, http://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/get-involved/, accessed on May 7, 2017. There are other criteria, but these two illustrate the non technical attempts to control who participates in this interface.]

Unlike the Codex Sinaiticus web bible interface, which was released to any user that has access to the internet, the DBL interface is only available to those approved by the Partnership Credentials Committee. The need for such a process of approval likely has to do with the sensitive copyright information being negotiated in the DBL, but at the same time, it functions as a means of limiting the anarchic tendencies built into the interface itself. The four terms listed under the tag line for the DBL on the main page of their website are, in order, "Security," "Uniformity," "Availability," and "Accountability."^[https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/, accessed on May 7, 2017.] The positioning of these terms is important. Availability, the value that connects most closely to the anarchic tendencies of the DBL interface, is bracketed by security and accountability. Only in the context of these kinds of controls does the DBL interface champion availability and the close attention to criteria for attaining a library card in DBL supports this kind of minimization of anarchy. Technologically, DBL affords proximity in a reasonably high surface area interface, though lower than some others we have seen, that has expansive collaborative capacities and anarchic tendencies in the possibilities of developing new interfaces from the DBL interface. In practice, there are logistical processes in place that could limit the range of collaborative capacities and anarchic tendencies available in the DBL interface. To see how this negotiation plays out in practice, we will look at two of the early and significant users of the DBL bible interface, YouVersion bible app (bible.com) and American Bible Society's Bible Search site (bibles.org).

### Bible Goes Mobile ###

One of the main users of the DBL bible interface is the incredibly popular bible interface produced by Life.Church called YouVersion.^[Tim Hutchings has done some detailed description and careful sociological analysis of the religious use of YouVersion's Bible App in “Now the Bible Is an App: Digital Media and Changing Patters of Religious Authority,” in Religion, Media, and Social Change, ed. Kennet Granholm, Marcus Moberg, and Sofia Sjö (New York: Routledge, 2014), 143–61. In his recent volume, *Liquid Scripture: The Bible in a Digital World* (New York: Fortress, 2017), Jeffrey Siker also considers YouVersion's Bible app as one example of bible on screen.] It's utter dominance in the mobile bible market has allowed the app to take on the more generic name of simply "The Bible App."^[I will refer to YouVersion's app as the "Bible App" from now on to indicate the dominance this particular bible interface has garnered in the mobile application space.] In the app store on Apple's iOS, the name of the app is simply "Bible" and their own language in the description of the app simply refers to it as The Bible App.^[The web address for the bible app is http://www.bible.com.] Although this bible interface most definitely pushes far beyond the book in many ways, the icon for The Bible App is a cartoon representation of a leather bound print codex with a red silk bookmark and the title "Holy Bible" in gold letters on the cover. The iconicity of bible as book still has a role to play even in these emerging interfaces that seem to crack its binding.^[This bound print bible icon is what identifies this bible app among other apps on a user's mobile device and is the favicon (image that shows in the tab for the site) and centered at the top of bible.com. The primary visual brand of the bible app is this bound print bible icon.] Though the Bible App works in a web browser and on any internet capable mobile device on the market today, I will focus on the operation of the Bible App on an iPhone 7 running iOS 10.3. As I have mentioned before, each different device interface offers different affordances in concert with the Bible App interface, yet the basic insights about the possibility for proximity in interface would apply to all of the possible devices. 

Perhaps the place to begin with a bible interface like the Bible App, which is used predominantly on mobile devices, is a consideration of the high surface area promoted by the sheer number of users of this interface. The number of users of a roll or codex bible interface are quite limited given geographical, social, and literacy limitations. A Kindle bible interface is limited by the finances of purchasing the Kindle book and having a device that can read Kindle books. The Codex Sinaiticus Project speaks often of its one million visitors, which is a massive expansion of accessibility in terms of a single bible interface. DBL as an interface only has a handful of library card holders, so the number of users is kept to a minimum. The Bible App has a counter on their site's home page that tracks the number of unique devices that have installed the "completely free, with no advertising and no in-app purchases" mobile app. Of course, this number is always expanding, but at the time of writing this sentence, the number of devices having downloaded the Bible App was 270,763,095. Nearly three hundred million devices using this one bible interface is a grand scale of high surface area.

### Our Daily Bread ###

Once a user opens the app, the expansive surface area continues. At the time of this writing, the Bible App offers a user just over 1500 bible versions in over 1000 different languages and some of these versions include both audio and text. Much like the codex bible was as much a library as a book, collecting together different writings from different contexts together in one interface, the Bible App too functions as a library of bible content in a consolidated interface.^[These version statistics are presented to the user of the Bible App at the top of the Versions view in the mobile app. These versions come from the DBL interface I discussed above. Comparing the May 2017 statistics from DBL to the number of versions available in the Bible App, we find that DBL holds 1535 text entries in 1154 languages, slightly higher numbers than included in the Bible App. See http://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/2017/05/01/may-2017-content-update/#more-917 for the report, accessed on May 8, 2017.] The home page of the app presents a user with an array of messages signaling things that can be done with the app or ways to get involved in the communities who use the app, such as downloading bible versions for offline use or participating in reading plans. One of the predominant structures found in the Bible App interface is the Verse of the Day functionality, which also appears on the home page when users access the app. Every day, a verse is selected and presented in text and in text over image form and offered to users across the platform.^[At present, I am unable to find any information regarding the selection algorithm used for which verse is presented to users on which day.] The text of the bible is broken into verse size bits and offered as a different surface each day of the year. These daily bits are also gathered together in an aggregated Verse of the Day view in the interface to provide a calendrical navigation through the bible in image and text. By breaking the text into verse sized bits, delivering them to a user out of context, and creating an ongoing emerging aggregation of these bits that need not reflect the organization of any original, the Verse of the Day function in the Bible App demonstrates both high surface area and anarchic tendencies. The collaborative capacities of the Bible App interface are also on display in the Verse of the Day functionality, by allowing a user to attach their own image to the verse of the day and easily share this out through social media channels. In the settings associated with the Verse of the Day, a user can elect to have the text and/or image verse of the day sent to their email or sent to the screen notifications of their mobile device (push notifications). Though these settings offer efficient ways for users to contact the content provided by the Bible App interface, they could have an effect of disincentivizing user participation in the interface and thus lowering the surface are and collaborative capacities of the Bible App. Surface area as a part of the affordance of proximity increases user involvement, it does not simply enable more efficient consumption of content.

Moving from left to right along the global navigation of the Bible App interface, the next user option after Home is "Read."^[This global navigation menu is only available in portrait mode on a device the size of an iPhone 7. When the phone is turned horizontally into landscape mode in the reader view of the Bible App, the global navigation goes away to make as much readable area on the screen as possible.] The primary reading interface does not require an account and offers a simple and accessible set of features for a user. The textual area shows one chapter of scrollable text at a time including in-line verse numbers and copyright information at the bottom of each chapter. A user can enable or disable options to show red letters, cross references, and footnotes when available in the text.^[The red letter and ] Much like we saw in the Kindle bible interface, additional collaborative capacities in the interface affording user construction of the space include choice of font size, font type, and a light or dark background. Unlike the Kindle bible interface, user selection of a larger font in the Bible App does not change the amount of text displayed on a single page, if we consider a page the scrollable text available at one time without having to navigate using the next page or previous page icons. A Kindle user, by choosing a font size, actually determines the size of a page, requiring more page turns for larger fonts and vice versa. In the Bible App, font size does impact how much text is on the viewable screen at a time and can increase or decrease the amount a user needs to scroll to get through the text. Yet, structurally, in the Bible App, chapter defines the "page," not amount of text, and page numbers are not present anywhere within the interface. In this way, the Bible App has made a decisive move beyond the book as an interface. 

The basic navigation of the Bible App interface reinforces this chapter based structure. There are simple forward and backward arrow icons at the bottom of the screen that allow the user to easily move linearly through the bible chapter by chapter. At the top of the reader view, there are two selection menus that display the current book, chapter and version being displayed. Clicking on the chapter selector menu allows a user to browse through the content of this bible version and choose a book and chapter to display. The books in this selection list can by ordered by "traditional" canonical order, as they typically appear in print bibles, or alphabetically. Changing bible versions is made simple by the version selector, which allows for filtering the list by language and offers a search function to locate a particular version by name or abbreviation. Finally, the basic reading interface of the Bible App also offers search as a navigational option. This exponential expansion of non-linear access to text affords a user an incredible amount of agency in participating in the interface. A search for keywords, names, references, etc. will return an aggregated list of verses from throughout the text that have some mention of or relationship to the search terms. Clicking on any one of the verses returned will show that single verse alone in the interface, with an option to see the full chapter from which the verse comes.^[As is customary practice, the copyright information for the version used to display the verse is also included on the page.] By default, these search results are returned in order of relevance


-- audio adds surface area, but perhaps decreases collaborative capacities?
-- reading plans??
-- email verse of day seems low surface area and low collaborative capacity.


* I wonder if the reading plans of YouVersion are actually a decreased surface area in comparison to the high surface area of participation in a roll, where user has to roll the book to locate the pertinent passage for a particular reading. If an interface simply tweets or emails a user with a passage, it seems that this could actually be a lack of surface area on the participation end, even if the several channels of interaction with the text could be an increase of surface area. It is critical that surface area increase involvement, not just consumption of content and perhaps this is the difference here?
