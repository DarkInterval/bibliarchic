particularly a space that is something other than a space 'between,' points toward a second way of theorizing interface through Edward Soja's notion of thirding. 

If interface is a product of relations, not simply the material affordances of a technology, then interface is a space and a process, not simply a thing (Drucker 2011, 3). With this notion of interface as space and process, we need a way to talk about the participants in this spatial process. 

In order to better understand this productive process of reading, we will look toward interface theory. Often, we associate interface with digital technologies. Human Computer Interface (HCI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) have become major areas of study and discourse in the world of software design.^[Give some examples.] If we look at the basic uses of '[interface](https://www.google.com/search?q=interface+definition)' in the English language, we can see the strong indication of interaction and connection as well as the prevalent use in the computing arena.^[Google Search for 'interface definitionâ€™ on August 1, 2015.] When I take up the language of interface, I do not want to limit our conversation to digital technologies that afford human interaction with machines. Interface offers a broader category for spaces of encounter that include many forms of media and mediation. In order to more clearly articulate the rich possibilities of interface, I will offer three related ways to think of interface theoretically - interface as zone of encounter, interface as thirdspace, and interface as process.
 

A few examples will help highlight this specific use of the term in the technological realm. A web page is often thought of as an interface of the computing variety.  and an API...

## Two cultural metaphors for interface ##

Before we move on to explore interface as both space and process through Johanna Drucker's suggestion of interface as zone of encounter, I'd like to mention two other important examples of interface that have shaped my thinking significantly: the relationship between new media object and cultural interface in Lev Manovich and S. Brent Plate's discussion of *The Skin of Religion*.^[I'd like to highlight that my attraction to interface as a concept emerged out of conversations I had about water as a surface with Timothy Beal at the Nida School of Translation Studies 2014. In Beal's lectures at NSTS 2014, he offered the idea of bible as media and we discussed the possibility of water as a metaphor for this phenomenon. It was the material and theoretical connotations of water as sur-face, both in the biological realm and in Hebrew scriptures that pushed me to consider the possibility of bible as interface.]

## Reading as Material Production ##

I will focus primarily on the readerly uses of bible, these relationships between user and interface, which produce the material encounters that constitute the reading process.

Maybe add a section here on different notions of emergence or wait and do this down in the probability section

Actually, I might throw out all of this and put a different theory of emergence in its place.

## Interface as Process ##

With Piotr Blumczynski's new book *Ubiquitous Translation*[^37] and the focus on the WHAT and HOW, I feel like I could link the WHAT and HOW of reading in Drucker to the WHAT and HOW of translation and suggest that interface is a kind of translational event. In a sense then, we have at least two kinds of translations going on with bible, a material media translation of book from print codex to mobile phone as well as the translational act that is interface.

If we look back to the computing definition of interface we began with earlier in this chapter, the idea of translation emerged even there. As Blumczynski suggests, translation is ubiquitous and I would argue that interface is a translational act. So, there are two reasons I bring in Piotr's work here. First, highlight the value of translation as a paradigm for the notion of interface we are working with here. Second,
