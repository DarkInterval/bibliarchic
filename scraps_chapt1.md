If interface is a product of relations, not simply the material affordances of a technology, then interface is a space and a process, not simply a thing (Drucker 2011, 3). With this notion of interface as space and process, we need a way to talk about the participants in this spatial process. 

In order to better understand this productive process of reading, we will look toward interface theory. Often, we associate interface with digital technologies. Human Computer Interface (HCI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) have become major areas of study and discourse in the world of software design.^[Give some examples.] If we look at the basic uses of '[interface](https://www.google.com/search?q=interface+definition)' in the English language, we can see the strong indication of interaction and connection as well as the prevalent use in the computing arena.^[Google Search for 'interface definitionâ€™ on August 1, 2015.] When I take up the language of interface, I do not want to limit our conversation to digital technologies that afford human interaction with machines. Interface offers a broader category for spaces of encounter that include many forms of media and mediation. In order to more clearly articulate the rich possibilities of interface, I will offer three related ways to think of interface theoretically - interface as zone of encounter, interface as thirdspace, and interface as process.
 

A few examples will help highlight this specific use of the term in the technological realm. A web page is often thought of as an interface of the computing variety.  and an API...

## Two cultural metaphors for interface ##

Before we move on to explore interface as both space and process through Johanna Drucker's suggestion of interface as zone of encounter, I'd like to mention two other important examples of interface that have shaped my thinking significantly: the relationship between new media object and cultural interface in Lev Manovich and S. Brent Plate's discussion of *The Skin of Religion*.^[I'd like to highlight that my attraction to interface as a concept emerged out of conversations I had about water as a surface with Timothy Beal at the Nida School of Translation Studies 2014. In Beal's lectures at NSTS 2014, he offered the idea of bible as media and we discussed the possibility of water as a metaphor for this phenomenon. It was the material and theoretical connotations of water as sur-face, both in the biological realm and in Hebrew scriptures that pushed me to consider the possibility of bible as interface.]

## Reading as Material Production ##

I will focus primarily on the readerly uses of bible, these relationships between user and interface, which produce the material encounters that constitute the reading process. I begin with the assumption that reading is a material act of production, no matter what the medium. Reading is material. Whether with an ancient papyrus roll, a medieval illuminated manuscript, a print codex, a computer screen, or a mobile phone, reading is an act shaped by both the materialities of the medium and the user.^[I am aware of the limitations of talking about medium and user as distinct entities and the ease with which we might slip into simple subject/object binaries here. One of the difficult tasks of this project is to challenge these dichotomies in so far as they encourage a subject consuming object model of reading. Perhaps the emerging discussions of object oriented ontology could provide an interesting conversation partner with interface theory. Imagining both medium and user as objects that have properties and methods they bring to an encounter could help emphasize the entangled production of reading as process model I am advocating for here.] There has been an upsurge of interest in the materiality of religion and the materiality of scripture in recent years.^[Give some examples from Wimbush and Signifying scriptures to Material Scripture section at SBL to Brent Plate and material religion to Manuel Vasquez Material Theory of Religion to Iconic Books.] The dethroning of textuality at work in this attention to the materiality of books and artifacts in religious traditions has deeply shaped my own approach to the study of bible. Yet, I want to push us to consider the materiality of the so called "virtual" -- digital technologies, computers, the internet, social media, mobile devices, the cloud, artificial intelligence.^[Drucker also challenges the material movement to consider more thoughtfully the materiality of the virtual, pointing back to the Abrahamic traditions of mapping matter to flesh (Drucker 2009, 7).] These media too have materialities that shape the encounters they afford and the idea of interface can help us stay attentive to the materiality of reading in the age of the internet. 

Reading is production. This may seem like an obvious statement, but it is important to remember that in any medium, a book is not simply a container of information to be ingested by a reader. The materialities and cultural contexts of both book and user entangle to produce the possibility for meaning in a reading act. Each encounter between book and user has the potential to offer something different, because reading is a production of meaning contingent upon the particularities of the encounter and its participants. If I read Emmanuel Levinas's *Otherwise than Being* in a hard bound print monograph as an undergraduate student in the early 2000's while sitting in the library at a small liberal arts college in Colorado, this will produce something different than my reading of the same text on a computer screen in a continuous scroll text editor as a late stage doctoral student in my house at the dawn of a Trump presidency. Though the "content" or the words of the text may remain identical in both of these cases, the readings simply can not remain the same. These two reading events are moments in the ongoing making that is my reading of *Otherwise Than Being*. In this sense, perhaps it would be more useful to talk about reading with a book rather than reading a book to help unsettle our typical notions of reading as consumption.
