**Chapter 2: Affording Proximity **
Proximity is a valuable affordance that helps negotiate the familiar anxiety of changing notions of nearness and distance as new technologies emerge. 

Drucker asks humanists to do more theorizing of interface to push design toward principles that take into account the values and practices of the humanities. In this chapter, I take up this call by bringing the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas and particularly his notion of proximity as subjectivity to bear on a theory of interface as space of interaction that demands difference. Drucker's primary concern is to bring the ambiguity of the constructivist subject to bear on the conceptions of reading interfaces in our emerging media landscapes. For her, the concept of subject interrupts the static and over determined operations of user and interface in the software industry. I have already argued for a focus on reader as user, to interrupt our embedded assumptions about the relationship between reader and bible. Even if I do not take up the explicit subject language advocated by Drucker, I follow her lead in exploring how a different paradigm of subjectivity might shape our theorizing about interface and even our practices of interface design.

## Introducing Affordance ##

Affordances were first introduced in by James J. Gibson, a perceptual psychologist, in 1977 in an article titled "The Theory of Affordances" (Gibson 1977). Gibson expands on this theory in his 1979 book, *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception*, where he offers the definition "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill" (Gibson 1979, ??). An important aspect of Gibson's invention of affordances is their relational nature. An affordance is the relationship between the physical properties of a "surface" and an organism encountering that surface (Gibson 1979, ??). 

Taking Gibson's lead, I will offer an example using codex as a surface engaged or used by a reader.^[Gibson's example is the relationship between an animal and a terrestrial surface. See Gibson 1979, ??.] The physical properties of a codex include flexible pages bound together on one long side with a cover on the front and back. The pages have writing on them. This codex *affords* reading for the reader. More specifically, the codex affords non-linear access to text because of the physical properties of binding on one side and flexible pages instead of being rolled up in one long sheet from one end to the other as in a scroll. This is simply one example of the relationship between physical properties of space and the affordances offered in the relationship with a user.

The critical piece of Gibson's theory is the relational nature of affordances and the way affordances problematize the binary between subject and object (Gibson 1979, ??). An affordance is not simply a property of an object or of a subject. Affordances are probabilistic productions in the entanglement of space and participant. This sounds a good bit like an interface. Since we have established that interfaces are zones of encounter, not containers reducible to the physical properties of the space they construct, affordances can be used to describe the possibilities offered by the process of encounter that constitutes an interface. ^[As noted in chapter 1, the basic distinction between the mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter presents the reader with a set of possibilities that condition a reading event that will inevitably be new every time (Drucker 2009, 14).] In their irreducibility to either subject or object properties, interface and affordance offer us a different way to examine the process of encounter that occurs between bible and user.

## Affordance and Interface ##

One limitation of Gibson's theory of affordances is that the relationality of the affordance is in the end an entanglement of the physical properties of a surface and the behavior capacities of an organism. In a sense then, as long as the combined physical properties of space and participant allow for some action, then this relationship is an affordance. Donald Norman brought Gibson's notion of affordances into the world of human-computer interface design and focused the concept on those actions "perceived" as possible or likely by a user of an interface by combining the operations of affordances, signifiers, and constraints (Norman 2013, 145). Rather than exploring any action made possible by the relationship between the physical properties of an interface and the capacities of a user, Norman focused more on the possible uses that would make sense to a user when encountering an interface.^[In the first chapter of the revised and expanded edition of *The Design of Everyday Things*, Norman tells the story of his relationship with Gibson and their fundamental disagreements about the interpretive role of the brain in the relationship between agents and objects (Norman 2013, 12). Norman is clear about his indebtedness to Gibson and the important contribution Gibson made to helping designers pay more attention to the information offered by the physical world.] 

One of the major additions to the revised edition of Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*, is the introduction of signifers as the properties of an interface that make an affordance visible (Norman 2013, 14). If affordances are all of the possible relationships between an interface and a user, then signifiers signal the visible or perceived affordances for the user. Norman offers a touch screen as a fitting example for our exploration of reading interfaces. The entire screen affords touch in relationship with a user, but a button is the signifier of *where* to touch, the perceived affordance (Norman 2013, 13-14). Understandably, Norman is focused on intuitive and useful interface design, with primarily the designer in mind, so introducing the property of a signifier to help designers talk about what they are adding to an interface to point to an affordance makes good sense. Yet, one of the reasons I will stay closer to the more generic notion of affordances as we discuss bible as interface is to distance our design and analysis of interfaces from the singular intent of the "appropriate" or "proper" use of an interface as determined by the designer. In Norman's definiton of signifer, we can see this emphasis on the proper at work. He says, "For me, the term *signifier* refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a user" (Norman 2013, 14). This signifer as indicator of "appropriate behavior" is different than an affordance, which is the possible relationships between a surface and an agent, a platform and a user. Now, Norman does allow for accidental or unintentional signifiers, which maintains some semblance of our focus on probabilistic production.^[His example of walking a path through a field paved by other walkers hearkens back to our discussion of strategies and tactics in De Certeau's notion of everyday practice as a mechanism of probabilistic production (Norman 2013, 14).] Yet, his emphasis on understandability as connected to the communication of "appropriate behavior" could lead toward design governed by determining mechanistic consumption rather than provoking probabilistic production. 

In addition to the role of affordances and signifiers, which make affordances perceivable to the user, Norman introduces another set of relationships into the process of constructing the possibility set offered by an interface, constraints. Norman introduces several types of constraints - physical, cultural, semantic, and logical - but the type most pertinent for our discussion is cultural. Norman says, "Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial restrictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many cases leaving only one or two possibilities" (Norman 2013, 76). In a return to his distinction between perception and understanding, Norman suggests that these cultural constraints allow users to move from simply perceiving a possible relationship with an interface to *understanding* this relationship (Norman 2013, 145). I have no doubt that cultural constraints influence the zone of encounter that is interface, yet I take issue here with the linear distinction between perception and understanding, as if perception itself is not already culturally constrained. 

Attracted most readily by cognitive science, Norman looks to concepts in the brain such as schemas, scripts and frames to explain cultural constraints and their impact on the possibility sets offered by an interface. Though these cognitive structures are a valuable way of exploring the operations of culture, as a cultural theorist, I prefer to leverage the notion of cultural dispositions. Here we begin to see the overlap between the theory of affordances and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of *habitus*. Like Gibson and Norman, Bourdieu too was looking for theoretical ways to understand human practice or action without reducing such phenomena to either objectivist or subjectivist analysis (Bourdieu *Outline of Theory*, ??). **More on connection between the cultural constraints in Norman and the structuring structures in Bourdieu.**^[For more on this connection between affordances and habitus see Fayard and Weeks, "Affordances for Practice", 2014]

** NEED to push from affordance to dispositions because i think that will help in the interface history below, talking about the dispositions afforded by roll, codex and kindle -- maybe focus on a few such as closedness and atomization or something?

c. Closer and Closer - Problem of Nearness and Distance

Throughout the history of technological change, one of the consistent questions that arises is how to deal with the expanding affordance of nearness offered by new technologies. Nearness in the context of interface typically suggests a spatial or relational contiguity that facilitates easier access to resources or easier exchange of information. Transportation technologies like horses, automobiles, and airplanes effectively increased nearness by decreasing the energy and time required to travel across large distances. Communication technologies such as the telephone, email, and mobile devices have expanded nearness by increasing our ability to communicate across vast distances in short time spans with increasing amounts and types of data. In the realm of bible interfaces, the Codex Sinaiticus Project web interface has brought me as a user much nearer to this 4th century manuscript. First of all, this project brings together fragments of the manuscript into one space of encounter from four different libraries around the world. Instead of traveling to the British Library, the Library of the University of Leipzig, the National Library of Russia in Saint Petersburg, and the Holy Monastery of the God-Trodden Mount Sinai to encounter all of the extant portions of this important codex, I can browse them all from a single web interface on my computer no matter where I am in the world. This aggregation of artifacts into one interface is one form of nearness afforded by digitization of manuscripts and internet technologies. 

In addition to the collecting of fragments, the Codex Sinaiticus Project website provides high resolution digital images with easy zoom capabilities, transcriptions, english translations, and physical descriptions of each leaf of each quire that is extant. Due to the lighting techniques used to capture the digital images of the manuscript and the zoom capabilities, this interface of the manuscript can offer a user a closer or nearer look at some of the details of the material manuscript that would even be possible handling the manuscript sitting in the reading room of the British Library. Without a doubt, this web interface of Codex Sinaiticus increases nearness by allowing many more people to engage this historic book with ease and by highlighting details of the manuscript that may escape a user participating in other interfaces of the manuscript. In light of the immense benefits provided by this nearness to Codex Sinaiticus, it is also without question a *different* encounter with the manuscript than turning the fragile pages with sterile gloves in a climate controlled reading room at the University of Leipzig. As my colleague Danny Yencich reminded me in a discussion of the digital materiality of the Codex Sinaiticus project, this web interface does not provide a user is an encounter with the spine, covers and binding of this book. Yencich rightfully asks, "Are such paratexts really so unimportant for the study of this book?"^[For the full context of this conversation and quote from Yencich, see "Codex All the Way Down" at http://aproximatebible.postach.io/post/codex-all-the-way-down .] There are undoubtedly other significant changes in the way we study and imagine this fantastic book in this alternative material interface. What do we lose not experiencing the sound and smell of the page turns or in foregoing the process of turning pages at all? Does the granular access to one leaf at a time shape a different conception of the whole codex and the relationship between the fragments? 

Similar questions and concerns about the growing affordance of nearness are prevalent in the contemporary debates about the impact of internet, social media, and mobile technologies on human cognition and human relationship. Nicholas Carr has been a consistent voice of concern over the increasing nearness of internet reading interfaces. FIND MY EARLIER WRITING ON THIS. 

Sherry Turkle has become a prominent public voice in discussions of technology and its social effect, as evidenced in the impressive attention^[https://storify.com/textpotential/turkle-face-to-face] captured by her new book, *Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age* (Turkle 2015). I first encountered Turkle's work while engaging a Richard Cohen article, 'Ethics and Cybernetics: Levinasian Reflections,' (Cohen 2000) in my struggle with the face to face language in online education. Using her work from 1995, *Life on the Screen* (Turkle 1995), Cohen offers Turkle as an example of media scholars who champion the advantages of cybernetics and internet communication technologies for redefining subjectivities in the direction of post-modern notions of multiplicity and instability (Cohen 2000, 27, n. 2).

Turkle's more recent work has shifted focus from this earlier celebration of the fragmented self to a serious anxiety about the effects of robotics and mobile devices on our social capacities as humans (Turkle 2011; Turkle 2015). Two minutes into a 2015 NPR interview titled 'Making the Case For Face to Face in an Era of Digital Conversation,'^[http://www.npr.org/2015/09/26/443480452/making-the-case-for-face-to-face-in-an-era-of-digital-conversation] Turkle suggests that 'face to face conversation is the most human and humanizing thing that we do, it's where we learn to put ourselves in the place of the other.' For many, this phrase, 'face to face,' as Turkle uses it has come to represent 'real' human interaction as opposed to a weak simulation or even cheap imitation that happens through internet media. In a sense, we could describe Turkle's concerns as the growing tendency people have to choose one kind of nearness, a thin nearness as we saw in Carr's work, over a more 'real' and valuable nearness of the so called 'face to face.' Stated another way, Turkle warns us of the detrimental effects (greater distance) on personal relationship and intimacy brought about by the ever expanding nearness to information and connection provided by mobile devices and internet technologies. Her provocative suggestion of the negative impact of a mobile phone on the table during an interview is a perfect illustration of this interplay of nearness and distance. The ever expanding nearness offered by the mobile phone introduces some distance between the two people sitting in the radio studio together, and this exchange is a net loss in Turkle's estimation.

## Heidegger - technology as distancelessness without nearness 

Introna's reflections on ethics in internet communication technologies demonstrated the ongoing conversation about our human response to the changes in space and time enacted by the emergence of the internet. It was a similar anxiety about the impact of technologies on our experience of nearness and distance and the potential changes for human relationships that gave rise to Heidegger's Bremen lectures, from which came QCT. 

## Questioning Technology ##

The core problem Heidegger identifies with technology in QCT is quite related to the concerns I have already discussed in Johanna Drucker's questioning of the mechanistic determinism of interface design in the software industry and my own concerns about common notions of reader as consumer of content in a container. In fact, this concern about the reduction of humans to some kind of deterministic homogeneity provides a thread that connects Drucker's theory of interface, Heidegger's concern about technology, and Levinas's philosophy of proximity. Levinas does not spend much time addressing technology directly, but with the themes operating in Heidegger's QCT as a bridge, I will connect the notion of proximity in Levinas to our concept of interface as space that demands difference. 

QCT is a revised version of the second of a four part lecture series Heidegger gave in Bremen in 1949 as his first public address after the war ended (Blitz 2014).^[Blitz 2014 provides a useful exploration of the relationship of QCT to the Bremen lectures and to the larger themes in Heidegger's work.] Heidegger begins the lecture series with a clear statement of the issue he is confronting, saying, "All distances in time and space are shrinking" (2012, 3). The larger lecture series explores the changing relationship between distance and nearness with the rise of modern technologies such as airplanes, radio, film, and television (Heidegger 2012, 3). In a subtle twist of the more well known title of the expanded version of lecture two, "The Question Concerning Technology," the concern in these questions about technology is what happens to the possibility of nearness as difference as technologies afford a kind of distancelessness? (Heidegger 2012, 4). Heidegger will go on to articulate the essence of technology as the process that renders all being, humans and nature included, as distanceless without nearness. He begins the second lecture saying, "All mastery of distances brings no nearness at all" (Heidegger 2012, 23). It is worth pointing out again that this problem of the relationship between distance, technology, and the human continues to occupy technology theorists today. These historical philosophical discussions in Heidegger and Levinas still speak loudly to the concerns about intimacy and the digital in Sherry Turkle's work, the questions of community and the internet pursued by Introna, and the role of subject in interface explored by Drucker.^[One of the most explicit expressions of this focus on distance and the human in emerging technologies, particularly related to Levinasian proximity, is Roger Silverstone's suggestion of a "proper distance" as the possibility for ethical/moral human relationships in cyberspace (2003).] As we will see below, proximity in Levinas can be read, in part, as a response to Heidegger's reflections on nearness, distance, and human encounter. 

Now that we have contextualized QCT within the larger Bremen lecture series and the ongoing contemporary discussion about the role of distance and nearness in human relationship in emerging technologies, I will turn to some specific reflections on QCT. Far from a complete analysis of Heidegger's philosophy of technology, I will focus narrowly on how technology as a revealing, as a "truth of Being," can provide a backdrop for the role of proximity in Levinas as a negotiation of this problem of nearness and distance.^[For more exhaustive studies of Heidegger's thinking and writing on technology, Blitz 2014 provides a fantastic introduction and Ihde 2010 offers a thorough contextualization and critique of Heidegger's views.] After a statement of his methodology of questioning, Heidegger combines the example of a silver chalice with a reading of the four Aristotelean causes to suggest that the instrumental definitions of technology are correct, but not true (Heidegger 1977, 4-11). Heidegger agrees that technology as a means to an end most definitely describes our relationship to technologies in some fashion, but that the essence of technology can not be reduced to this instrumentality. 

After this long analysis, he writes, "Technology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we give heed to this, then another whole realm for the essence of technology will open itself up to us. It is the realm of revealing, i.e., of truth" (Heidegger 1977, 12).^[The translators note to the last word of this quote gives an explanation of the relationship between *Wahrheit* and the *bergen* stem words Heidegger uses to talk about revealing and its related terms (Heidegger 1977, 12, n. 12.). After a short discussion of the etymology of *techne*, Heidegger restates this claim emphatically, saying, "Technology is a mode of revealing. Technology comes to presence [West] in the realm where revealing and unconcealment take place, where *aletheia*, truth, happens."] All of these terms here -- revealing, unconcealment, *aletheia*, and truth -- are terms Heidegger uses to talk about being as well. In fact, this connection of revealing and truth is as old as *Being and Time* and relates closely to the phrase Levinas distances from in his writings on Celan and elsewhere, "truth of Being."^[Point to a few studies of revealing and truth in BT.] Thus, technology, for Heidegger, is only one kind of revealing. This particuar revealing that is the essence of Technology presents a danger, the tendency to turn all things, humans and nature included, into interchangeable units of resources (standing-reserve). 

This revealing that homogenizes, Heidegger calls *Gestell*. Before he introduces the term, he describes this process that produces the world as interchangable units as 

> The revealing that rules throughout modern technology has the character of a setting-upon, in the sense of a challenging­ forth. That challenging happens in that the energy concealed in nature is unlocked, what is unlocked is transformed, what is transformed is stored up, what is stored up is, in turn, distributed, and what is distributed is switched about ever anew (Heidegger 1977, 16).^[It is not lost on me that this description of the enframing and standing reserve at work in Heidegger's notion of the essence of technology has some incredible similarities with Lev Manovich's articulation of new media objects, particularly in their property of transcoding (Manovich 2002).]

Through this enframing or positionality (Gestell)^[See Blitz 2014 for an extended discussion of the role of QCT in the Bremen lectures and for the difference in translation choice here between enframing and positionality to render Gestell. Blitz suggests that both are unable to contain all of the nuances of Gestell in QCT and seems to elect for a focus on the idea of "challenging."], a technological kind of unconcealing, all things, including humans, are reduced to interchangeable resources that can be leveraged as needed for efficiency and production. Even in the realm of science, according to Heidegger, technology has made nature into "standing reserve," simply a set of resources ready for use. In his own questioning of Heidegger's questions about technology, Don Ihde suggests that this idea of Technology as Gestell (Ihde capitalizes Technology here to signal that we are not talking about technologies) is a "*metaphysical* perspective" for Heidegger and marks the signature of Heidegger's unique approach to these questions (Ihde 2010, 18-19). The danger, which happens to be the title of the third lecture in the Bremen series, of technology as enframing, lies in the transformation of all things into standing-reserve, distanceless without nearness (Heidegger 2012, 44). This collapse of distance without nearness is so engulfing that it prohibits all other forms of revealing, such as poeisis (Heidegger 1977, 33).
