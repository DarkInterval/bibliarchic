**Chapter 2: Affording Proximity **
Proximity is a valuable affordance that helps negotiate the familiar anxiety of changing notions of nearness and distance as new technologies emerge. 

Drucker asks humanists to do more theorizing of interface to push design toward principles that take into account the values and practices of the humanities. In this chapter, I take up this call by bringing the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas and particularly his notion of proximity as subjectivity to bear on a theory of interface as space of interaction that demands difference. Drucker's primary concern is to bring the ambiguity of the constructivist subject to bear on the conceptions of reading interfaces in our emerging media landscapes. For her, the concept of subject interrupts the static and over determined operations of user and interface in the software industry. I have already argued for a focus on reader as user, to interrupt our embedded assumptions about the relationship between reader and bible. Even if I do not take up the explicit subject language advocated by Drucker, I follow her lead in exploring how a different paradigm of subjectivity might shape our theorizing about interface and even our practices of interface design.

## Introducing Affordance ##

Affordances were first introduced in by James J. Gibson, a perceptual psychologist, in 1977 in an article titled "The Theory of Affordances" (Gibson 1977). Gibson expands on this theory in his 1979 book, *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception*, where he offers the definition "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill" (Gibson 1979, ??). An important aspect of Gibson's invention of affordances is their relational nature. An affordance is the relationship between the physical properties of a "surface" and an organism encountering that surface (Gibson 1979, ??). 

Taking Gibson's lead, I will offer an example using codex as a surface engaged or used by a reader.^[Gibson's example is the relationship between an animal and a terrestrial surface. See Gibson 1979, ??.] The physical properties of a codex include flexible pages bound together on one long side with a cover on the front and back. The pages have writing on them. This codex *affords* reading for the reader. More specifically, the codex affords non-linear access to text because of the physical properties of binding on one side and flexible pages instead of being rolled up in one long sheet from one end to the other as in a scroll. This is simply one example of the relationship between physical properties of space and the affordances offered in the relationship with a user.

The critical piece of Gibson's theory is the relational nature of affordances and the way affordances problematize the binary between subject and object (Gibson 1979, ??). An affordance is not simply a property of an object or of a subject. Affordances are probabilistic productions in the entanglement of space and participant. This sounds a good bit like an interface. Since we have established that interfaces are zones of encounter, not containers reducible to the physical properties of the space they construct, affordances can be used to describe the possibilities offered by the process of encounter that constitutes an interface. ^[As noted in chapter 1, the basic distinction between the mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter presents the reader with a set of possibilities that condition a reading event that will inevitably be new every time (Drucker 2009, 14).] In their irreducibility to either subject or object properties, interface and affordance offer us a different way to examine the process of encounter that occurs between bible and user.

## Affordance and Interface ##

One limitation of Gibson's theory of affordances is that the relationality of the affordance is in the end an entanglement of the physical properties of a surface and the behavior capacities of an organism. In a sense then, as long as the combined physical properties of space and participant allow for some action, then this relationship is an affordance. Donald Norman brought Gibson's notion of affordances into the world of human-computer interface design and focused the concept on those actions "perceived" as possible or likely by a user of an interface by combining the operations of affordances, signifiers, and constraints (Norman 2013, 145). Rather than exploring any action made possible by the relationship between the physical properties of an interface and the capacities of a user, Norman focused more on the possible uses that would make sense to a user when encountering an interface.^[In the first chapter of the revised and expanded edition of *The Design of Everyday Things*, Norman tells the story of his relationship with Gibson and their fundamental disagreements about the interpretive role of the brain in the relationship between agents and objects (Norman 2013, 12). Norman is clear about his indebtedness to Gibson and the important contribution Gibson made to helping designers pay more attention to the information offered by the physical world.] 

One of the major additions to the revised edition of Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*, is the introduction of signifers as the properties of an interface that make an affordance visible (Norman 2013, 14). If affordances are all of the possible relationships between an interface and a user, then signifiers signal the visible or perceived affordances for the user. Norman offers a touch screen as a fitting example for our exploration of reading interfaces. The entire screen affords touch in relationship with a user, but a button is the signifier of *where* to touch, the perceived affordance (Norman 2013, 13-14). Understandably, Norman is focused on intuitive and useful interface design, with primarily the designer in mind, so introducing the property of a signifier to help designers talk about what they are adding to an interface to point to an affordance makes good sense. Yet, one of the reasons I will stay closer to the more generic notion of affordances as we discuss bible as interface is to distance our design and analysis of interfaces from the singular intent of the "appropriate" or "proper" use of an interface as determined by the designer. In Norman's definiton of signifer, we can see this emphasis on the proper at work. He says, "For me, the term *signifier* refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a user" (Norman 2013, 14). This signifer as indicator of "appropriate behavior" is different than an affordance, which is the possible relationships between a surface and an agent, a platform and a user. Now, Norman does allow for accidental or unintentional signifiers, which maintains some semblance of our focus on probabilistic production.^[His example of walking a path through a field paved by other walkers hearkens back to our discussion of strategies and tactics in De Certeau's notion of everyday practice as a mechanism of probabilistic production (Norman 2013, 14).] Yet, his emphasis on understandability as connected to the communication of "appropriate behavior" could lead toward design governed by determining mechanistic consumption rather than provoking probabilistic production. 

In addition to the role of affordances and signifiers, which make affordances perceivable to the user, Norman introduces another set of relationships into the process of constructing the possibility set offered by an interface, constraints. Norman introduces several types of constraints - physical, cultural, semantic, and logical - but the type most pertinent for our discussion is cultural. Norman says, "Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial restrictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many cases leaving only one or two possibilities" (Norman 2013, 76). In a return to his distinction between perception and understanding, Norman suggests that these cultural constraints allow users to move from simply perceiving a possible relationship with an interface to *understanding* this relationship (Norman 2013, 145). I have no doubt that cultural constraints influence the zone of encounter that is interface, yet I take issue here with the linear distinction between perception and understanding, as if perception itself is not already culturally constrained. 

Attracted most readily by cognitive science, Norman looks to concepts in the brain such as schemas, scripts and frames to explain cultural constraints and their impact on the possibility sets offered by an interface. Though these cognitive structures are a valuable way of exploring the operations of culture, as a cultural theorist, I prefer to leverage the notion of cultural dispositions. Here we begin to see the overlap between the theory of affordances and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of *habitus*. Like Gibson and Norman, Bourdieu too was looking for theoretical ways to understand human practice or action without reducing such phenomena to either objectivist or subjectivist analysis (Bourdieu *Outline of Theory*, ??). **More on connection between the cultural constraints in Norman and the structuring structures in Bourdieu.**^[For more on this connection between affordances and habitus see Fayard and Weeks, "Affordances for Practice", 2014]

** NEED to push from affordance to dispositions because i think that will help in the interface history below, talking about the dispositions afforded by roll, codex and kindle -- maybe focus on a few such as closedness and atomization or something?

c. Closer and Closer - Problem of Nearness and Distance
    i. what do we mean by nearness and distance here?
    i. Anxieties about emerging technologies (Carr, Turkle, etc.)
    ii. Plato - writing and memory - Plato is nervous that the nearness offered by writing will atrophy the operations of memory. A certain distance
    ii. Heidegger - distancelessness without nearness

Throughout the history of technological change, one of the consistent questions that arises is how to deal with the expanding affordance of nearness offered by new technologies. Nearness in the context of interface typically suggests a spatial or relational contiguity that facilitates easier access to resources or easier exchange of information. Transportation technologies like horses, automobiles, and airplanes effectively increased nearness by decreasing the energy and time required to travel across large distances. Communication technologies such as the telephone, email, and mobile devices have expanded nearness by increasing our ability to communicate across vast distances in short time spans with increasing amounts and types of data. In the realm of bible interfaces, the Codex Sinaiticus Project web interface has brought me as a user much nearer to this 4th century manuscript. First of all, this project brings together fragments of the manuscript into one space of encounter from four different libraries around the world. Instead of traveling to the British Library, the Library of the University of Leipzig, the National Library of Russia in Saint Petersburg, and the Holy Monastery of the God-Trodden Mount Sinai to encounter all of the extant portions of this important codex, I can browse them all from a single web interface on my computer no matter where I am in the world. This aggregation of artifacts into one interface is one form of nearness afforded by digitization of manuscripts and internet technologies. 

In addition to the collecting of fragments, the Codex Sinaiticus Project website provides high resolution digital images with easy zoom capabilities, transcriptions, english translations, and physical descriptions of each leaf of each quire that is extant. Due to the lighting techniques used to capture the digital images of the manuscript and the zoom capabilities, this interface of the manuscript can offer a user a closer or nearer look at some of the details of the material manuscript that would even be possible handling the manuscript sitting in the reading room of the British Library. Without a doubt, this web interface of Codex Sinaiticus increases nearness by allowing many more people to engage this historic book with ease and by highlighting details of the manuscript that may escape a user participating in other interfaces of the manuscript. In light of the immense benefits provided by this nearness to Codex Sinaiticus, it is also without question a *different* encounter with the manuscript than turning the fragile pages with sterile gloves in a climate controlled reading room at the University of Leipzig. As my colleague Danny Yencich reminded me in a discussion of the digital materiality of the Codex Sinaiticus project, this web interface does not provide a user is an encounter with the spine, covers and binding of this book. Yencich rightfully asks, "Are such paratexts really so unimportant for the study of this book?"^[For the full context of this conversation and quote from Yencich, see "Codex All the Way Down" at http://aproximatebible.postach.io/post/codex-all-the-way-down .] There are undoubtedly other significant changes in the way we study and imagine this fantastic book in this alternative material interface. What do we lose not experiencing the sound and smell of the page turns or in foregoing the process of turning pages at all? Does the granular access to one leaf at a time shape a different conception of the whole codex and the relationship between the fragments? 

## Growing Anxieties ##

Similar questions and concerns about the growing affordance of nearness are prevalent in the contemporary debates about the impact of internet, social media, and mobile technologies on human cognition and human relationship. Sherry Turkle has become a prominent public voice in discussions of technology and its social effect, as evidenced in the impressive attention^[https://storify.com/textpotential/turkle-face-to-face] captured by her new book, *Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age* (Turkle 2015). I first encountered Turkle's work while engaging a Richard Cohen article, 'Ethics and Cybernetics: Levinasian Reflections,' (Cohen 2000) in my struggle with face to face language in online education. Using her work from 1995, *Life on the Screen* (Turkle 1995), Cohen offers Turkle as an example of media scholars who champion the advantages of cybernetics and internet communication technologies for redefining subjectivities in the direction of post-modern notions of multiplicity and instability (Cohen 2000, 27, n. 2).

Turkle's more recent work has shifted focus from this earlier celebration of the fragmented self to a serious anxiety about the effects of robotics and mobile devices on our social capacities as humans (Turkle 2011; Turkle 2015). Two minutes into a 2015 NPR interview titled 'Making the Case For Face to Face in an Era of Digital Conversation,'^[http://www.npr.org/2015/09/26/443480452/making-the-case-for-face-to-face-in-an-era-of-digital-conversation] Turkle suggests that 'face to face conversation is the most human and humanizing thing that we do, it's where we learn to put ourselves in the place of the other.' For many, this phrase, 'face to face,' as Turkle uses it has come to represent 'real' human interaction as opposed to a weak simulation or even cheap imitation that happens through internet media. In a sense, we could describe Turkle's concerns as the growing tendency people have to choose one kind of nearness, a thin nearness, over a more 'real' and valuable nearness of the so called 'face to face.' Stated another way, Turkle warns us of the detrimental effects (greater distance) on personal relationship and intimacy brought about by the ever expanding nearness to information and connection provided by mobile devices and internet technologies. Her provocative suggestion of the negative impact of a mobile phone on the table during an interview is a perfect illustration of this interplay of nearness and distance. The nearness afforded by the mobile phone introduces some distance between the two people sitting in the radio studio together, and this exchange is a net loss in Turkle's estimation.

Turning more specifically to books and users, Nicholas Carr has been a consistent voice of concern over the increasing nearness of internet reading interfaces. In his more current work, *The Glass Cage* and *Utopia is Creepy*, Carr continues to provide a useful voice challenging assumptions that the growing ubiquity of internet and computer technologies have a positive impact on human lives.^[Cite both books here.] The book that put Carr on the map, though, was a book specifically about reading and the internet titled *The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains*.^[Cite Shallows here.] In this book, Carr's argument is basically that the distractive hyperlinking affordances of internet reading interfaces is rewiring the human brain to think more shallowly. Carr's attention to the neuroplasticity of the human brain even in adults and the impact of interface use on the shaping of brain pathways provides an excellent example of the material entanglement that operates in interface. Human brains designed internet reading platforms and these interfaces are now participating in the design of the human brain. Yet, rather than simply pointing to the differences emerging in neural pathways that seem connected to reading on the internet, Carr laments the waning of the codex interface and identifies these new dispositions and brain wirings as "shallow."^[Give one example where Carr states this lament fairly clearly. Carr actually begins his entire analysis with a look back to McLuhan’s most famous book, *Understanding Media*, and his most well know aphorism, “the medium is the message.” Although he clearly respects the prescience and value of McLuhan’s work, even using McLuhan’s own language as the subtitle for his prologue, Carr immediately betrays an underlying fear of change and nostalgic anxiety as he emphasizes McLuhan’s polemic against the neutralists without any attention given to McLuhan’s celebration of art and social reorganization in the retribalization made possible by the collapse of time and space brought on by electric technology. McLuhan’s idea of the “global village,” made popular in his earlier book, *The Gutenberg Galaxy* (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1962) encapsulates the retribalization process I mention here. While Carr gives no attention to this part of McLuhan’s discussion of electric technology, I can’t help but hear echoes of McLuhan’s global village when I read Clay Shirky’s assessment of the internet age in *Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age* (New York: Penguin Press, 2010), which offers a stark and compelling counterpoint to Carr’s pessimism. Carr leverages McLuhan’s clever and incisive claims about the power of technology in shaping human culture, but all the while operates with a sense that the dangers of digital technology are inevitably fatal. Though McLuhan is exceedingly clear on the risks of technological change and advancement, the tone of *Understanding Media* strikes me as loaded with potential and possibility, whereas even Carr’s title spells doom.]

The anxiety that drives Carr's argument in *The Shallows* stems from a loss of the distance provided by the print codex interface. Internet technologies afford increasing nearness with an always expanding set of possible things to engage, such that users can no longer focus in a sustained manner on a singular, linear text. On the contrary, a codex affords a more singular nearness in interface, with covers to mark what is in and what is out typically with some measure of linear progression from beginning to end. In Carr's imagination, the codex provides a focused and contained nearness that creates a distance from all other things, which in turns facilitates a deep thinking that is more valuable than the shallowness afforded by the internet. Long durations of time and the concept of depth are also forms of distance and Carr finds these affordances of distance in the codex interface. For Carr, the growing ubiquity of internet reading interfaces afford a nearness of multiple foci, shorter durations, and lack of depth that have a decidedly negative impact on human learning and knowledge.^[Cite one of his tirades about this.] 

## Nothing New ##

In his long historical run up to the current media situation of the internet, Carr reminds readers that the anxiety around changes in technology and its impact on the human brain are not at all new. In the 4th century before the common era, as the technology of an alphabet began to take root, writing emerged as a new technology for communication and learning. Following the lead of Walter Ong's analysis of Plato is his work *Orality and Literacy*, Carr points to what seems to be a negative view of writing in *Phaedrus* and more positive views on literacy in *The Republic*.^[Carr, *The Shallows*, Kindle location 953-1016.] Ong and Carr reference the well trodden passage from *Phaedrus* that communicates a worry about the impact of writing on memory, since writing affords easy reference to a content set outside the memory of an individual.^[*Phaedrus* 275b; Ong, *Orality and Literacy*, 78-81.] Undoubtedly, these reflections on an entirely different time period of major technological transition provide a helpful reminder that these anxieties about emerging technologies are not a new phenomenon. Further reflections on this anxious passage from *Phaedrus* in conversation with other mentions of writing in the Platonic corpus point less to a concern about the difference between internal and external memory technologies and more toward a worry about the impact of writing on dynamic dialog. Lane Wilkinson's analysis of the views on writing in *Phaedrus*^[https://senseandreference.wordpress.com/2010/10/27/reading-writing-and-what-plato-really-thought/ .] points toward a passage shortly following the anxious bit about memory, where Socrates says to Phaedrus,

> I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying answer. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves.^[*Phaedrus* 275d-e]

One way to frame this concern is as an anxiety about the increasing nearness or availability of a written text to a user and the corresponding distancing of the speaker or author. If, as Wilkinson suggests, the primary value operative for Plato is dialog, then writing provided an interface in antiquity that afforded a new kind of nearness to words and ideas that threatened the participation in dialog. Susan Dobra points to a short passage in the "Seventh Letter" that highlights this again, where Plato says, "that is why no intelligent man will ever dare to commit his thoughts to words, still less to words that cannot be changed, as is the case with what is expressed in written characters."^[*Seventh Letter* 343; http://www.csuchico.edu/phil/sdobra_mat/platopaper.html.] As both Wilkinson and Dobra highlight so nicely, it is the fixicity of written text that affords an irresponsible nearness for the reader in exchange for the dynamics of dialog. This concern about the impact of increasing nearness provided by new technologies, particularly the effects it might have on the ambiguity and dynamics of dialog sound similar to Drucker's questioning of the mechanistic determinism of contemporary interface theories operative in the software world. In a sense, both Plato and Drucker are advocating for a nearness of the subject over the nearness of content. 

## Distancelessness Without Nearness 

In a much nearer time period, Martin Heidegger delivered a set of lectures just after the second world war addressing the changes in nearness and distance brought about by the rise of mechanical technologies.^[The more well know essay by Heidegger, "The Question Concerning Technology" (QCT) is a revised version of the second lecture of this four part lecture series Heidegger gave in Bremen in 1949  Blitz 2014 provides a useful exploration of the relationship of QCT to the Bremen lectures and to the larger themes in Heidegger's work.] These lectures, know as the Bremen lectures, occurred in Bremen in 1949 as Heidegger's first public address after the war ended. He begins the lecture series with a clear statement of the issue he is confronting, saying, "All distances in time and space are shrinking" (2012, 3). The rest of the lecture series explores the changing relationship between distance and nearness with the rise of modern technologies such as airplanes, radio, film, and television (Heidegger 2012, 3). Heidegger frames his concern in terms of distance not nearness, because he will redefine nearness as something exceeding the spatial and relational closeness we have been exploring thus far. Distance, for Heidegger remains spatial or relational, while nearness comes to signify an intimate encounter related to truth, which experiences the "actuality" of a thing, and technology does not offer this even as it collapses the distance of space and time.^[Find the exact reference for this.] In a subtle twist of the more well known title of the expanded version of lecture two, "The Question Concerning Technology," the concern in these questions about technology is what happens to the possibility of nearness as difference when technologies afford a kind of distancelessness? (Heidegger 2012, 4). Heidegger will go on to articulate the essence of technology as the process that renders all being, humans and nature included, as distanceless without nearness.^[For more exhaustive studies of Heidegger's thinking and writing on technology, Blitz 2014 provides a fantastic introduction and Ihde 2010 offers a thorough contextualization and critique of Heidegger's views.] He begins the second lecture saying, "All mastery of distances brings no nearness at all" (Heidegger 2012, 23). Though the language is a bit different, the distancelessness that has Heidegger bothered is a historically located version of the anxiety we saw about the affordance of nearness in Plato, Turkle, and Carr. 

After a long analysis instrumental definitions of technology in relation to the Aristotelean causes, Heidegger writes, "Technology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we give heed to this, then another whole realm for the essence of technology will open itself up to us. It is the realm of revealing, i.e., of truth" (Heidegger 1977, 12).^[The translators note to the last word of this quote gives an explanation of the relationship between *Wahrheit* and the *bergen* stem words Heidegger uses to talk about revealing and its related terms (Heidegger 1977, 12, n. 12.). After a short discussion of the etymology of *techne*, Heidegger restates this claim emphatically, saying, "Technology is a mode of revealing. Technology comes to presence [West] in the realm where revealing and unconcealment take place, where *aletheia*, truth, happens."] This particular revealing that is the essence of technology presents a danger, the tendency to turn all things, humans and nature included, into interchangeable units of resources (standing-reserve). This revealing that homogenizes, Heidegger calls *Gestell*. Before he introduces the term, he describes this process that produces the world as interchangable units as 

> The revealing that rules throughout modern technology has the character of a setting-upon, in the sense of a challenging­ forth. That challenging happens in that the energy concealed in nature is unlocked, what is unlocked is transformed, what is transformed is stored up, what is stored up is, in turn, distributed, and what is distributed is switched about ever anew (Heidegger 1977, 16).^[It is not lost on me that this description of the enframing and standing reserve at work in Heidegger's notion of the essence of technology has some incredible similarities with Lev Manovich's articulation of new media objects, particularly in their property of transcoding (Manovich 2002).]

Through this *Gestell*, enframing or positionality,^[See Blitz 2014 for an extended discussion of the role of QCT in the Bremen lectures and for the difference in translation choice here between enframing and positionality to render Gestell. Blitz suggests that both are unable to contain all of the nuances of Gestell in QCT and seems to elect for a focus on the idea of "challenging."], a technological kind of revealing, all things, including humans, are reduced to interchangeable resources that can be leveraged as needed for efficiency and production. Even in the realm of science, according to Heidegger, technology has made nature into "standing reserve," simply a set of resources ready for use. In his own questioning of Heidegger's questions about technology, Don Ihde suggests that this idea of Technology as Gestell (Ihde capitalizes Technology here to signal that we are not talking about technologies) marks the signature of Heidegger's unique approach to these questions (Ihde 2010, 18-19). The danger, which happens to be the title of the third lecture in the Bremen series, of technology as enframing, lies in the transformation of all things into standing-reserve, distanceless without nearness (Heidegger 2012, 44). In standing-reserve, everything is so close at hand that difference is erased in the name of efficiency and consumption. For Heidegger, this lack of distance afforded by the rise of machines without facilitating a nearness of authentic relationship threatens the very being of humans.   

## Approaching Distance On the Internet ##

Also interested in the impact of these changes in scale of nearness and distance, another thinker, Roger Silverstone, more recently has taken up this question about distance in relation to internet technologies and cyberspace. Advocating for what he calls "proper distance" as a framework for the possibility of ethics in internet communication technologies, Silverstone argues for the necessity to resist the tendency toward the distancelessness and overnearness possible in emerging technologies as highlighted by Heidegger's anxieties we have just seen.  

More interested in the necessary conditions of a moral life on the internet age than in interface design or phenomenological philosophy, Silverstone's work is built upon the intersecting ideas of proximity in Zygmunt Bauman and Emmanuel Levinas. Proximity in normal parlance functions as a synonym for nearness but with a more sophisticated and scientific sound. NEED TO TRACE THIS TO my discomfort with proper and the provision usefulness of distance in ICTs. 

## Proximity: Contact Without Grasp ##

Though Levinasian proximity has a deep imprint on Silverstone, this philosophical notion of subjectivity in Levinas operates more explicitly as an affordance offered in interface. Rather than asking whether emerging technologies are ethical or whether ethical human relationship is possible in our present technological landscape,^[See Lucas Introna, "Phenomenological Approaches to Ethics and Information Technology", *The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/ethics-it-phenomenology/>, for an introduction to these kinds of questions.] I will use the operations of this interface that is proximity in Levinasian philosophy as a model for exploring the nearness and distance afforded by bible in its many lives as interface. Levinas himself speaks and writes very little about technology explicitly,[^circulation_images] but his negotiations of nearness and distance in human relationship through his idea of proximity have a great deal to offer our discussions of interface. 

[^circulation_images]: As Richard A. Cohen notes in his article "Ethics and Cybernetics: Levinasian Reflections," the most pivotal chapter of *OTB*, which is titled "Substitution," offers a fitting mention of proximity in relationship to terminology we often find in discussions of technology.^[Cohen, "Ethics and Cybernetics," 28.] After introducing the shortcomings associated with placing consciousness qua knowledge at the foundation of humanness, Levinas articulates an alternative, saying, 

> In starting with sensibility interpreted not as a knowing but as proximity, in seeking in language contact and sensibility, behind the circulation of information it becomes, we have endeavored to describe subjectivity as irreducible to consciousness and thematization. Proximity appears as the relationship with the other, who cannot be resolved into "images" or be exposed in a theme. It is the relationship with what is not disproportionate to the arche in thematization, but incommensurable with it, with what does not derive its identity from the kerygmatic logos, and blocks all schematism (Levinas 1971, 101).

Right in the middle of this passage, Levinas makes a fairly straightforward case for proximity as a kind of interface. He writes, "Proximity appears as the relationship with the other, who cannot be resolved into 'images' or be exposed in a theme" (Levinas 1971, 101). As we discussed in chapter one, interface is a space of interaction that demands difference. Proximity is a relationship with the other, not simply an articulation of nearness or distance or just a theory of subjectivity or the subject, but a relationship of encounter. This relationship is with an other term that can not be resolved or exposed, thus demanding a kind of interaction that can not be reduced to sight, knowledge, or even language. Though my main focus on interface theory has been on human relationship with machine in the computing realm, proximity as human-human sociality, relationship with an other that demands responsibility and does not allow the eradication of difference fits our theory of interface quite well.

Proximity as a different approach to human relationship than ontology or being blossoms in the last of Levinas's large phiosophical works, *Otherwise Than Being* (*OTB*).^[Levinas, *Otherwise Than Being*, 16-17, writes, "Everywhere proximity is conceived ontologically, that is, as a limit or complement to the accomplishment of the adventure of essence, which consists in persisting in essence and unfolding immanence, in remaining in an ego, in identity. Proximity remains a distance diminished, an exteriority conjured. The present study sets out to not conceive proximity in function of being."] Proximity emerges in *OTB* as an approach that increases the nearness of responsibility and at the same time increases the distance from mastery. Immediately, we can see here that proximity is not a synonym for nearness and that nearness is no longer simply the opposite of distance. Proximity becomes a problematization of the distance/nearness spatial binary, where both nearness and distance are redefined and enhanced in a process of "approach" that demands responsibility and resists mastery. Levinas writes, "for proximity is not a simply asymptotic approach of its 'term.' Its term is not an end. The more I answer the more I am responsible; the more I approach the neighbor with which I am encharged the further away I am."^[Levinas, *OTB*, 94.]

In this resistance to the asymptote as a metaphor for proximity, Levinas indicates concepts of nearness and distance that are not derived simply from spatial contiguity or its lack. First and foremost, proximity is near as sociality, a "relationship with," not simply a physical closeness in space and time.^[Levinas, *OTB*, 17, writes, "It figures as what is near in a proximity that counts as sociality, which 'excites' by its pure and simple proximity."] This "relationship with" is the core of interface as we have defined it in chapter one with the help of Johnna Drucker, so we can already imagine proximity as a kind of interface. The nearness of this proximity, which can not be reduced to physical or cognitive closeness,^[Levinas, *OTB*, 48, writes, "An analysis that starts with proximity, irreducible to consciousness of..., and describable, if possible, as an inversion of its intentionality, will recognize this responsibility to be a substitution."] is conceptualized with many other terms by Levinas, such as approach, contact, and responsibility. All of these terms connote a kind of engagement that is a process of being approached by a neighbor or a stranger that demands a response (response-ability) more than an intentionally willed choice to approach another and engage. This nearness in proximity demands participation before there is a choice. In a simple sense, the nearness of proximity describes as a process (approach) of encounter (contact) that demands participation (responsibility).

Typically, the kind of nearness just discussed, a nearness of approach, would involve a demand for an intimate knowledge of the other person to make the "relationship with" of proximity compelling. Yet, Levinas is exploring a nearness that is not dependent on such a knowledge, where approach as response precedes knowing. Here is where distance plays a role in proximity. There are two distances at work in the discussion of proximity in *Otherwise than Being.* The first distance is the distance of sight or knowledge or what Levinas phrases as the incomplete objective genitive construction, "consciousness of... ."^[Levinas, *OTB*, 90.] This distance is simply the distance required for a subject to comprehend an object or for the eye to see an object. The nearness of proximity squeezes this distance by enacting a contact that precedes comprehension, an encounter that is blurry. While proximity in a Levinasian sense resists this distance of comprehension through a nearness of sociality not reducible to understanding, another kind of distance emerges.^[Levinas, *OTB*, 90, writes, "Proximity, suppression of the distance that consciousness of... involves, opens the distance of a diachrony without a common present, where difference is the past that cannot be caught up with, an unimaginable future, the non-representable status of the neighbor behind which I am late and obsessed by the neighbor. This difference is my non-indifference to the other. Proximity is a disturbance of the rememberable time."] This second distance is another way of articulating the difference always at work in this encounter that is proximity. 

Levinas calls this distance "a diachrony without a common present," which suggests that even the nearness at work in proximity does not actually bring the two terms of this relationship or encounter or interface "together" in any reciprocal way in a shared appearance.^[Levinas, *OTB*, 90.] This distance as diachrony or difference is not somehow an interruption of an original synchrony or sameness, to which a system is hoping to return. Rather, this distance as the ever expanding and insatiable demand by the other consistently troubles any attempts to master the needs of the other. Levinas writes, "The subject is the more responsible the more it answers for, as though the distance between it and the other increased in the measure that proximity was increased."^[*OTB*, 139-40. I would argue that Levinas unhelpfully uses proximity as a synonym for nearness in this passage, since proximity is the dual operation of increasing distance and nearness.] This sounds a great deal like Levinas's reflections on the asymptote metaphor we saw above, where he writes, "The more I answer the more I am responsible; the more I approach the neighbor with which I am encharged the further away I am."^[Levinas, *OTB*, 94.] Here, the "further away" that indicates distance refers to the inexhaustibility of the responsibility operative in proximity. At no point, can one draw near enough through the approach of responsibility to master the needs of the other. Instead, as the nearness of proximity increases through response to the demand of the other as encounter, so does the inability to fulfill this demand and thus distance also increases. In short, this distance in proximity is resistance to mastery of the other by either exhausting the demand or returning to a originary synchrony of shared appearance. Proximate distance has no end or beginning, it is anarchic. 

In this Levinasian reconstitution of human subjectivity, proximity is an expansion of both nearness and distance. Nearness is an involvement with the other that is characterized by a distance that resists mastery of the other. The interplay of this nearness and distance involved in the relationship that is proximity enacts both the proximity of contact and the ever ap-proximate response to the demand of the other, because it can never be mastered. This constant entanglement of nearness and distance brings together two other important terms used by Levinas in his explorations of *OTB*, disinterested non-indifference, which I have used as a synonym for proximity.^[] Disinterested describes the difference of distance in dis-inter-esse, interrupting the need for a shared horizon of essence or sameness in order to participate in the relationship of proximity. Non-indifference communicates the engagement or nearness at work in the response-ability toward the demand of the other. So, in a sense, disinterested non-indifference could be translated as distance nearness, both of which are attempts at articulating the operation of proximity in Levinas.^[Levinas, *OTB*, 139-141.]

## Affording Proximity in Interface ##

Can this notion of proximity in human-human interface articulated by Levinas be applied to human-machine interfaces in the context of use of bible? I think it can and Levinas offers at least two hints in this direction. First, as Sean Hand highlights so wonderfully in his analysis of Levinas's evolving relationship with art, 

Second, in a set of interviews conducted on French radio with Philippe Nemo, Levinas describes his relationship with bible in language that sounds a great deal like the operations of proximity. In fact, it was these interviews that first stimulated my interest in the possibility of bible as a proximate interface.
