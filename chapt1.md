CHAPTER 1: INTERFACE

**Face to Face**

Why would I suggest that bible or book could be thought of as an
interface? Often, we associate interface with digital technologies.
Human Computer Interface (HCI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) have
become major areas of study and discourse in the world of software
design. Yet, the word 'face' has come to signify human interaction
unmediated by digital technologies in the common phrase 'face to face.'
There is a great deal of discussion these days about the different
values of online/virtual/digital interaction and the so-called 'face to
face.' For example, Sherry Turkle has become a prominent public voice in
discussions of technology and its social effect, as evidenced in the
impressive attention[^16] captured by her new book, *Reclaiming
Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age*.[^17] I first
encountered Turkle's work while engaging a Richard Cohen article,
'Ethics and Cybernetics: Levinasian Reflections,'[^18] in my struggle
with the face to face language in online education. Using her work from
1995, *Life on the Screen*,[^19] Cohen offers Turkle as an example of
media scholars who champion the advantages of cybernetics and internet
communication technologies for redefining subjectivities in the
direction of post-modern notions of multiplicity and instability.[^20]

Turkle's more recent work has shifted focus from this earlier
celebration of the fragmented self to a serious anxiety about the
effects of robotics and mobile devices on our social capacities as
humans.[^21] Two minutes into a 2015 NPR interview titled 'Making the
Case For Face to Face in an Era of Digital Conversation,'[^22] Turkle
suggests that 'face to face conversation is the most human and
humanizing thing that we do, it's where we learn to put ourselves in the
place of the other.' For many, this phrase, 'face to face,' as Turkle
uses it has come to represent 'real' human interaction as opposed to a
weak simulation or even cheap imitation that happens through internet
media.

Part of why the language of inter\*face\* compels me is because it can
unsettle this binary between digital interfaces and this 'face to face'
advocated by Turkle. Conversation over the coffee table and exchanges on
Twitter can both be understood as interface and both are mediated by
technologies if we understand language as a technology. So, this term,
'interface,' pushes beyond any digital/analog or virtual/real
dichotomies and demands that we think about interface design in whatever
media we find ourselves using. In a way, we could imagine 'interface,'
the intersection of faces, as a useful translation of the phrase 'face
to face.'

If we look at the basic uses of 'interface' in the English language, we
can see the strong indication of interaction and connection as well as
the prevalent use in the computing arena.

Here in these definitions,[^23] we can see that the 'face to face'
championed by Turkle and others can easily fit into the notion of
interface as 'a point where two subjects meet or interact.' When I take
up the language of interface, I am not limiting our conversation to
digital technologies that afford human interaction with machines. I hope
to explore interface as a broader category for spaces of encounter that
include many forms of media and mediation.

**Zone of Encounter**

Johanna Drucker offers an approach to interface that fits well with this
idea of spaces of encounter. In her essay, 'Humanities Approaches to
Interface Theory,' Drucker helpfully intertwines digital media studies
explorations of interface design with humanities questions of
subjectivity.[^24] In an exemplary fashion, Drucker demonstrates a
reflexive practice by stating her desire to explore the theory
undergirding her own scholarly working environments at the cusp of a
transition from print to other dominant media/interfaces.[^25]

![](media/image8.tiff){width="6.5in" height="4.045833333333333in"}

Drucker shows her awareness of the shifts at work in the emerging
digital media age and asks us as humanists to become a part of the
process of constructing a theory to support the design of our reading
and writing spaces as a counter balance to the often mechanistic
principles at work in software design.[^26] I see this project as
contributing to these efforts and I am grateful for the challenge from
Drucker and others. As she looks to GIS, social networking, and
visualization for hints of new possibilities, we may even look back into
print technologies (e.g. Talmudic page) for some suggestions toward
interface design that might afford a bible textual apparatus that is
'constellationary, distributed, and multi-faceted.'

Combining graphical reading analysis, frame analysis, and a
constructivist model of subjectivity, Drucker gives us a view of
interface as more of a theatre than a window.[^27]

![](media/image9.tiff){width="6.5in" height="3.4881944444444444in"}

Instead of a thing, interface is a zone of encounter. So, if we turn
toward books and reading more specifically, 'Interface is *what we read*
and *how we read* combined through engagement.’[^28] This is a critical
point in the relationship of bible and/as media. If an interface
involves both what we read and how we read, the design of the book
technologies we use when reading shapes the reading performance and
meaning made as much as the content. Reading bible in a codex is a
different zone of encounter than reading bible on an iPhone, thus, both
the book and the reader are constituted differently in these two
interfaces. This means that the transitions from scroll to codex and
codex to internet are not simply new ways of reading the same content.
Rather, bible and reader are both transformed in the new space of
encounter made possible by these different interfaces.

Another way to state the importance of interface in the reading process
is to suggest that the structures of a particular book technology ARE
information, not merely a means of access to information. This is
another way of bothering the dichotomy between form and content or
medium and message. In this interface as zone of encounter, medium and
message are so inextricably entangled that attempting to tease them
apart is futile. Drucker highlights this well, saying,[^29]

![](media/image10.tiff){width="6.5in" height="2.41875in"}

In this example, the 'page'[^30] is not simply a window through which a
user accesses data. Rather, the page is a part of the data and the data,
in part, structures the page. So, with a codex, the space of the page is
part of the data of the text, not simply a delivery mechanism. The shift
from zone to space in Drucker's language here, particularly a space that
is something other than a space 'between,' surfaces a potential contact
between interface and thirdspace in Edward Soja.

**Interface as Thirdspace**

Drucker is mostly focused on scholarly reading and writing practices and
the role of the human subject in the construction of these spaces. If
interface is a space of encounter, but something more than simply a
space between, then we can imagine resonances between Drucker's
interface theory and Edward Soja's notion of thirdspace. Interface as
space can push beyond the intersection of two systems toward creating
spaces that foster emergence. As I mentioned earlier, the term
'interface' has the potential to challenge the binary struggle between
both the virtual (digital) and real (face to face) and the what and the
how of reading practice. One of the most important operations of
thirdspace for Soja is to challenge any form of cultural inquiry that
reduces to binaries, so Druker's interface is already participating in a
value of thirdspace. In fact, the subtitle of Soja's *Thirdspace*[^31]
holds together the terms of this virtual/real binary by exploring
'real–and–imagined places.'

Soja builds off of Henri Lefebvre's work in *Production of Space*[^32]
to suggest an important role for spatiality in the process of cultural
meaning making. Soja begins his introduction with a focus on
participatory construction of space which sounds like the practice of
interface in Drucker.[^33]

![](media/image11.tiff){width="6.5in" height="1.7173611111111111in"}

This idea that we are "intrinsically spatial beings" is one example of
Drucker's suggestion of a constructivist subjectivity. For both Soja and
Drucker it is not simply that we together construct space but also that
spaces construct us as we construct spaces. Soja's mention of social
consequences here makes me think of Marsh McLuhan's famous adage that
the medium is the message. Though often misunderstood as reductionist or
absolutist, McLuhan is simply suggesting that the message of any medium
is its social effect not the content it contains.[^34] Both Soja and
Drucker do us a favor to remind us that our materiality which can be
called media or can be called spatiality has a significant impact on our
sociality. This is precisely what I hear McLuhan saying in the medium is
the message.

As we have seen, Drucker's notion of interface already challenges
binaries and encourages a more spatial and material and constructed
notion of both media and the subject. So, why add thirdspace into the
mix? What Soja'a thirdspace ads to our emerging theory of interface is
his approach of 'thirding as Othering,' which practices an infinite
preference for an alternative when faced with a binary choice.[^35] This
explicit and intentional methodology of surfacing multiplicity when
faced with a binary may not guide interface design or theory like it
does Soja's cultural critique. Yet, what I hear in Lefebvre's *il y a
toujour l'Autre* and in Soja's thirding-as-Othering is a disposition
toward emergence of the chaotic kind, alternatives that challenge
established categories and resist closed analysis without a need to
eradicate these categories. Interface as thirdspace pushes the
multiplicity Drucker encourages in her framing of interface toward a
property of emergence in interface that will always overflow our
analysis. Drucker says,[^36]

![](media/image12.tiff){width="6.5in" height="1.5694444444444444in"}

Drucker resists the strictly functional and mechanistic theories of
interface design and asks humanists to imagine something more variable
and responsive to the particularities of the people and the spaces
involved in interface. Interface as thirdspace suggests that even these
combinatorial particularities do not produce the total set of
possibilities, 'there is always an-Other.'

**Interface as Translation**

With Piotr Blumczynski's new book *Ubiquitous Translation*[^37] and the
focus on the WHAT and HOW, I feel like I could link the WHAT and HOW of
reading in Drucker to the WHAT and HOW of translation and suggest that
interface is a kind of translational event. In a sense then, we have at
least two kinds of translations going on with bible, a material media
translation of book from print codex to mobile phone as well as the
translational act that is interface.

**Book as Interface**

So, we have moved from the mechanistic idea of interface as a thing
through which we view data, to a constructivist interface as a zone of
encounter that constitutes a space and a subject, finally to a spatial
interface as thirdspace with a disposition toward interruptive
emergence. The important strand that follows this trajectory is the
continued challenge to any compartmentalization of what and how we read.
Just as interface is not simply a thing we look through, a book is not
just a container for content. A book is an invitation to an encounter in
the practice of reading and the materiality of this encounter has as
much to tell us about meaning as the stories we read.

Near the end of her exhortation to humanities scholars to take seriously
the task of building a theory of interface, Drucker reminds us that book
has always been an interface.[^38]

![](media/image13.tiff){width="6.5in" height="5.647916666666666in"}

I quote Drucker here at length for two reasons. First, I have at times
been prone to and accused of the charming 'strict binarisms and
technophilic exuberance' Drucker cautions of here. Though I have found
hyperbolic rhetoric useful at times to unsettle our unquestioned
assumptions about media, I want to be exceedingly clear that, with
Drucker, I am not interested in propagating some old/new hierarchical
dichotomy between codex and emerging book technologies. This is why I
began with material media translation as a palimpsest in my
introduction. Each emerging book technology is a translation of what
came before it, a writing over that never fully replicates and only
partially erases.

Second, this passage from Drucker begins and ends with a reminder that
book has always been an interface. As the materiality of this interface
shifts, we will undoubtedly learn from previous forms as we explore the
affordances of emerging technologies. The last full sentence of this
passage captures nicely the importance of understanding book as
interface. To paraphrase in alliterative fashion, Drucker suggests that
a book is an interface that *provokes probabilistic production* through
the reading event.[^39] Let's look closely at each of these p-words in
reverse order, production, probabilistic, and provokes.

Production

Drucker continues to pound home her constructivist approach to both
subject and text by reiterating that a text or work is *produced* in the
encounter facilitated by the book. This is another way of stating that
book is not simply a window or a container through which we access and
consume a text. Rather, book is a space (is it too reductionist to
correlate space and 'a structured environment' in Drucker?) that begs an
encounter between reader and the structured environment of the interface
and more. Drucker's foregrounding of reading as production rather than
simple consumption of a text reminds me of the problematization of the
production/consumption binary in Michel de Certeau's work, *The Practice
of Everyday Life*.[^40]

De Certeau's explorations of 'the practice of everyday life' respect the
deep concerns about commodification so well articulated by many
materialist critiques of culture, yet questions the often accompanying
low view of mass culture and pessimism concerning the everyman. De
Certeau restores some poetic dignity to the masses by reframing
consumption as *production*, giving each person in each moment an agency
in the meaning making endeavor.[^41]

![](media/image14.tiff){width="6.5in" height="2.345138888888889in"}

I am not explicitly taking up the power dynamics de Certeau so
beautifully explores in this work. Yet, his consistent challenge of the
production/consumption binary without erasing the role of the structures
or the participation of the 'consumer' reinforces our approach here of
book as interface that provokes production. De Certeau also helpfully
reminds me that book as interface does not necessarily erase the
operations of book as container. The container attributes of book remain
as a part of the material structures that constitute the potential
productive space of the interface.

De Certeau uses reading as one of his examples of "everyday practices
that produce without capitalizing.”[^42] He notes the often assumed
writing-reading binary as a specific example of the
production-consumption binary, but articulates a notion of reading that
can not be reduced to this dichotomy. Reading is a "silent production,”
"a play of spaces,” "an 'art' which is anything but passive,” and most
poingnantly, reading "transforms another person's property into a space
borrowed for a mo-ment by a transient.”[^43]  Reading as everyday
practice is a poiesis, a making, within structured constraints that
resists the production-consumption binary and thus offers a notion of
reading as encounter that produces both the reader and the text.

Probabilistic

In an essay titled 'Entity to Event: From Literal, Mechanistic
Materiality to Probabilistic Materiality,' Drucker expounds in much more
detail her use of the term probabilistic as it relates to reading
interfaces.[^44]

![](media/image15.tiff){width="6.5in" height="3.6152777777777776in"}

We can tell even in 'Interface Theory,' that probabilistic is an
alternative to mechanistic for Drucker in her analysis of the
shortcomings of interface design as driven by the software development
world.[^45] Here, in this passage from 'Entity to Event,' with its
strange alignment, we can see her ability to both show and tell the role
of materiality in the reading event. This claim of event rather than
entity is parallel to my suggestion that book as interface is an
encounter not just a container. The basic distinction between the
mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former
attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter
presents the reader with a set of possibilities that condition at
reading event that will inevitably be new every time.[^46]

![](media/image16.tiff){width="6.5in" height="1.9388888888888889in"}

This points back, in a way, to the interruptive emergence we found in
Soja's notion of thirdspace and begs a further discussion about the role
of complexity theory in Drucker's concept of interface as event.

&gt; MORE ON COMPLEXITY, PROBABILITY, AND EMERGENCE.

Rather than simply presenting a user with an entity to consume, a
probabilistic materiality of interface *provokes* production of both
text and subject in the practice of reading. Let's look more closely at
the provocation of interface, which Drucker suggests is related to the
cues and clues an interface offers for the performance of a text.

Provoke

I love that Drucker celebrates the provocation of reading interfaces. A
codex doesn't simply lay passive on the shelf waiting to be opened and
penetrated by the reader. The materiality of the book as interface
participates in and even provokes a reading event. A page from a book in
Amazon reader on my iPhone, which gives me as reader all kinds of power
over the page, provokes a possibility set of reading tactics, even if
not entirely determinative. Book as container just waits to be consumed,
book as interface provokes encounter.

This provocation reminds us that interface is an active participant as
structured environment in the production of meaning that is a reading
event. One way to talk about the material dispositions of an interface
is through affordances. Affordances are the set of real or perceived use
possibilities offered by the material design of an interface *in
relationship to a particular user and context*. The history of the term
affordance is well established, beginning with James J. Gibson in the
field of psychology and brought into the realm of HCI through Donald
Norman's book *The Psychology of Everyday Things*, which is charmingly
known as POET.[^47]

![](media/image17.tiff){width="6.5in" height="1.2979166666666666in"}

This is what Norman offers as a definition of affordance.[^48] As
McGrenere and Ho demonstrate, there is a lot of debate and extension
around this definition. For our purposes, the importance of affordance
is that there are material properties of an interface that present a
possibility set of uses to a reader. This is different than affordances
'determining' the reading event or even the total set of possibilities
for use. Here, I prefer to reach back to Gibson's use of affordance in
that he defines affordance relationally. MORE...

Affordances as a set of possibilities in a given field remind me of
Pierre Bourdieu's notion of habitus. Contrast the set of
structures/possibilities in interface affordance to the structuring
structures that present a subject with a possibility set in a field.
Neither are determinative for practice, but they do shape the space
significantly. MORE...

**Pathways**

Pathways Project

Thankfully, we already have some compelling and instructive examples of
people trying to design book as interface in our emerging media age.
John Miles Foley's *Pathways Project*[^49] offers an amazing example of
exploring book as interface that provokes probabilistic production in
the reading process. The Pathways Project explores the analogies between
oral tradition (oAgora) and the internet (eAgora) in their shared
challenge to the operations of print media (tAgora). The Pathways
Project is full of insights and limits, both of which can provide useful
launching places for our experiments here with book as interface.

Future of Academic Book

In her essay, Drucker makes some hints toward what we might find in
emerging scholarly interpretive reading interfaces. There is a movement
afoot that is gently and gradually trying to take seriously this call to
imagine the academic book as interface in our emerging media landscape.
The Future of the Academic Book project began as a collaborative
project...Though I have had a hard time seeing how the FOAB project has
interrupted the established dispositions of print and codex to allow the
possibilities of emerging technologies, the community of discourse that
has fostered this movement has most definitely demonstrated a desire for
and commitment to a constructivist and collaborative process. Their
patience and respect for tradition could create the necessary space for
translation of the deeply ingrained material sensibilities embedded in
the culture of the academic book. I hope to incorporate the innovative
spirit and the patient wisdom of both Drucker and the FOAB project as we
push toward imagining bible as interface.

We now have a model of book as interface that provokes probabilistic
production in the practice of reading and some examples of design in
this direction. In the next chapter, I will advocate for one particular
affordance in our design of bible as interface, anarchy.
