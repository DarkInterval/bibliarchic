Looking at bible in terms of users and interfaces instead of simply books and readers offers us four primary advantages. First, thinking of bible as interface rather than book can unsettle the unquestioned binding of bible and codex, which coincides with the dominant cultural reduction of book to codex. By looking back at the bible roll as an interface and forward to kindle reader as an interface for bible, we can imagine better what constitutes bible for users beyond our current limited conception of book. Second, a focus on bible as interface highlights the material affordances operative in different user relationships with bible that extend beyond typical modes of reading, such as annotation and illumination in margins, organizational schemes, and use of bible as artifact. Third, exploring bible as interface can challenge us to conceptualize bible through its use rather than reducing definitions of bible to the content it contains. Fourth, tracing the history of bible as interface allows us to see the continuities and discontinuities involved in media transitions/translations. An awareness of the ongoing relationships between familiar and emerging interfaces can help curb some of the anxiety that inevitably arises with new technologies. With these advantages in mind, I will describe three examples of bible as interface, the roll bible, the codex bible and the kindle bible. Before we look at each example, we need to understand the concept of affordances as a way to describe the possible relationships between a user and an environment or technological platform .  

## Introducing Affordance ##

Affordances were first introduced in by James J. Gibson, a perceptual psychologist, in 1977 in an article titled "The Theory of Affordances" (Gibson 1977). Gibson expands on this theory in his 1979 book, *The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception*, where he offers the definition "The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill" (Gibson 1979, ??). An important aspect of Gibson's invention of affordances is their relational nature. An affordance is the relationship between the physical properties of a "surface" and an organism encountering that surface (Gibson 1979, ??). 

Taking Gibson's lead, I will offer an example using codex as a surface engaged or used by a reader.^[Gibson's example is the relationship between an animal and a terrestrial surface. See Gibson 1979, ??.] The physical properties of a codex include flexible pages bound together on one long side with a cover on the front and back. The pages have writing on them. This codex *affords* reading for the reader. More specifically, the codex affords non-linear access to text because of the physical properties of binding on one side and flexible pages instead of being rolled up in one long sheet from one end to the other as in a scroll. This is simply one example of the relationship between physical properties of space and the affordances offered in the relationship with a user.

The critical piece of Gibson's theory is the relational nature of affordances and the way affordances problematize the binary between subject and object (Gibson 1979, ??). An affordance is not simply a property of an object or of a subject. Affordances are probabilistic productions in the entanglement of space and participant. This sounds a good bit like an interface. Since we have established that interfaces are zones of encounter, not containers reducible to the physical properties of the space they construct, affordances can be used to describe the possibilities offered by the process of encounter that constitutes an interface. ^[As noted in chapter 1, the basic distinction between the mechanistic and the probabilistic for Drucker is that the former attempts to present a user with an entity to consume, while the latter presents the reader with a set of possibilities that condition a reading event that will inevitably be new every time (Drucker 2009, 14).] In their irreducibility to either subject or object properties, interface and affordance offer us a different way to examine the process of encounter that occurs between bible and user.

## Affordance and Interface ##

One limitation of Gibson's theory of affordances is that the relationality of the affordance is in the end an entanglement of the physical properties of a surface and the behavior capacities of an organism. In a sense then, as long as the combined physical properties of space and participant allow for some action, then this relationship is an affordance. Donald Norman brought Gibson's notion of affordances into the world of human-computer interface design and focused the concept on those actions "perceived" as possible or likely by a user of an interface by combining the operations of affordances, signifiers, and constraints (Norman 2013, 145). Rather than exploring any action made possible by the relationship between the physical properties of an interface and the capacities of a user, Norman focused more on the possible uses that would make sense to a user when encountering an interface.^[In the first chapter of the revised and expanded edition of *The Design of Everyday Things*, Norman tells the story of his relationship with Gibson and their fundamental disagreements about the interpretive role of the brain in the relationship between agents and objects (Norman 2013, 12). Norman is clear about his indebtedness to Gibson and the important contribution Gibson made to helping designers pay more attention to the information offered by the physical world.] 

One of the major additions to the revised edition of Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*, is the introduction of signifers as the properties of an interface that make an affordance visible (Norman 2013, 14). If affordances are all of the possible relationships between an interface and a user, then signifiers signal the visible or perceived affordances for the user. Norman offers a touch screen as a fitting example for our exploration of reading interfaces. The entire screen affords touch in relationship with a user, but a button is the signifier of *where* to touch, the perceived affordance (Norman 2013, 13-14). Understandably, Norman is focused on intuitive and useful interface design, with primarily the designer in mind, so introducing the property of a signifier to help designers talk about what they are adding to an interface to point to an affordance makes good sense. Yet, one of the reasons I will stay closer to the more generic notion of affordances as we discuss bible as interface is to distance our design and analysis of interfaces from the singular intent of the "appropriate" or "proper" use of an interface as determined by the designer. In Norman's definiton of signifer, we can see this emphasis on the proper at work. He says, "For me, the term *signifier* refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a user" (Norman 2013, 14). This signifer as indicator of "appropriate behavior" is different than an affordance, which is the possible relationships between a surface and an agent, a platform and a user. Now, Norman does allow for accidental or unintentional signifiers, which maintains some semblance of our focus on probabilistic production.^[His example of walking a path through a field paved by other walkers hearkens back to our discussion of strategies and tactics in De Certeau's notion of everyday practice as a mechanism of probabilistic production (Norman 2013, 14).] Yet, his emphasis on understandability as connected to the communication of "appropriate behavior" could lead toward design governed by determining mechanistic consumption rather than provoking probabilistic production. 

In addition to the role of affordances and signifiers, which make affordances perceivable to the user, Norman introduces another set of relationships into the process of constructing the possibility set offered by an interface, constraints. Norman introduces several types of constraints - physical, cultural, semantic, and logical - but the type most pertinent for our discussion is cultural. Norman says, "Cultural constraints and conventions are learned artificial restrictions on behavior that reduce the set of likely actions, in many cases leaving only one or two possibilities" (Norman 2013, 76). In a return to his distinction between perception and understanding, Norman suggests that these cultural constraints allow users to move from simply perceiving a possible relationship with an interface to *understanding* this relationship (Norman 2013, 145). I have no doubt that cultural constraints influence the zone of encounter that is interface, yet I take issue here with the linear distinction between perception and understanding, as if perception itself is not already culturally constrained. 

Attracted most readily by cognitive science, Norman looks to concepts in the brain such as schemas, scripts and frames to explain cultural constraints and their impact on the possibility sets offered by an interface. Though these cognitive structures are a valuable way of exploring the operations of culture, as a cultural theorist, I prefer to leverage the notion of cultural dispositions. Here we begin to see the overlap between the theory of affordances and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of *habitus*. Like Gibson and Norman, Bourdieu too was looking for theoretical ways to understand human practice or action without reducing such phenomena to either objectivist or subjectivist analysis (Bourdieu *Outline of Theory*, ??). **More on connection between the cultural constraints in Norman and the structuring structures in Bourdieu.**^[For more on this connection between affordances and habitus see Fayard and Weeks, "Affordances for Practice", 2014]

** NEED to push from affordance to dispositions because i think that will help in the interface history below, talking about the dispositions afforded by roll, codex and kindle -- maybe focus on a few such as closedness and atomization or something?

I could explain affordances as the entangled materialities that construct the space of interface and then walk through the interface history of the bible as book looking for a few specific affordances, such as non-linear access, atomization, and aggregation/collection. Or I could simply describe each interface in terms of its affordances. Roll affords continuous access to text with reinforced sense of relationships of part to whole. Unlike our contemporary romance novels, it would be an onerous task to peek at the end of a story with this roll interface. Roll offers protection of writings and a kind of focus on a particular portion of text by only exposing bits of the text at a time to the user. In the end, I am deciding to stick to one notion of interface, user with platform, rather than push toward the multilayered interface of user-platform-user. 

## Bible as Interface: Roll Bible ##

On of the key things to remember as we explore the many interfaces of bible throughout history is that these interfaces all borrow from each other and media transitions are never total.

Before bible became Bible, it was book. Our concept of book has become so deeply entangled with the dominant book technology of nearly the last two millennia, the codex, that we forget that book has not always been codex. Depending on how broadly we want to define book and its relationship to writing, we could imagine book going all the way back to cave walls and stone tablets. I won't take us all the way down that road here to avoid the detours it might provide, but in the life of bible as book, it is at least important to consider the codexes immediate technological ancestor, the roll.^[as a future project, I would like to come back to this point and explore the relationship between the two tablets of exodus and the evolution of bible as cultural icon as Tim beal describes (total, closed, authoritative, etc.). I would start with William blakes plates of Moses with the tablets looking just like a coded.] The roll was the most common book format for literature and religious texts from ???? to ???? C.E. We find roll books mentioned by authors in the ancient world and in the bible itself. βιβλιον is the Greek word often translated "book" in the Septuagint and the New Testament. Yet, this word for book that becomes the signifier for the cultural phenomenon of christian scripture, and so much more, always refers to something otherwise than a codex in these ancient Greek texts. Here are a few examples (translations my own):

* LXX Exodus 24.17 - "And taking *the book* (το βιβλιον) of the covenant, he read it into the ears of the people and they said, 'All things, which the Lord said, we will do and we will hear.'"
* LXX Nehemiah 8.8 - "And they read in the *book* (βιβλίω) of the law of God, and Ezra taught and ordered [them] in knowledge of the Lord, and the people understood when he read."
* 2 Timothy 4.13 - "When you come, bring the cloak, which I left in Troas with Carpus, and *the books* (τα βιβλια), especially the parchments."

In English translation, with our deep assumption of book as codex, it is easy to read these passages and picture these ancient readers holding a giant leather bound codex. Yet, such a thing didn't even exist at the time of these writings. Rolls were regularly used in early gatherings for worship in communities that came to be known as Jewish. As an example, the scriptures mentioned in the gospel of Luke, from which Jesus read was a roll.^[Timothy Beal, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, offers a detailed look at this scene in the gospel of Luke and the way Jesus would have used the roll as an interface for reading. It is an excellent reminder that books and bibles have not always been in codex form.] 

As an interface, the roll offers a two handed user experience when reading that combines the analog, a continuity, and the digital, discrete bits. The typical roll book consists of several sheets of papyrus or parchment, glued together from edge to edge, written on one side in columnar fashion and rolled up for easy storage and protection. To read, a user would use one hand to unroll in the direction of reading, right to left in Hebrew, left to write in Greek, and the other hand to reroll the read portions of the text. A more contemporary, but already out of date, technology that emulates the mechanics of a roll is a cassette tape. If you can imagine rolling the two spools of a cassette tape by hand and reading for text on the tape, that is similar to how users interfaced with the roll. In fact, some rolls had handles that functioned like spools to enable the user to more easily move back and forth through the book. Imagine the inefficiency and frustration in this interface. Once you get to the end of a roll book, a user has to unroll (or is it reroll?) all the way back to the beginning to read again. I can imagine an ancient library staffing a circulation station with aspiring student scribes or scholars, where their only task was to roll back books from end to beginning after they had been used by a patron. Perhaps one of the reasons we find author attribution and colophon at the end of ancient roll manuscripts is because users often didn't rewind. 

The columns of writing in a roll book effectively deliniated what we would call pages today as a user would roll with both hands in concert until a single column or maybe a few columns of text were visible, they would read that column, and then would roll again when ready to move on. In this sense, roll as interface offered the user both a linear analog^[I would rather find other words to describe this difference rather than analog/digital. The important point to make in all interface analysis is that rarely do we have a binary situation because interfaces as relationships afford more than one type of use.] experience of rolling through the trajectory of a book along with a kind of digital processing of the discrete bits of text encountered column by column. Unlike a cassette tape, but much like the page turn of the codex, rolling to expose one or a few columns of text at a time breaks up the experience of a text, even if only for a second. This horizontal roll was not the only interface available for reading and writing use in antiquity, it was simply the preferred interface for longer texts and became the dominant roll book form for Israelite scriptures. Shorter decrees, contracts and letters could be found in a vertical arrangement with the rolling mechanism the same as the horizontal roll, but in a different orientation and the writing was continuous along the roll, rather than being written in discrete columns. With the absence of the columnar interruptions, the vertical roll provided a more continuous reading experience for the user than the horizontal roll.^[This vertical roll interface is akin to our contemporary relationship with reading on a web page, but with significant differences I will point out later when we consider the internet as an interface of bible.] Yet, if a user allowed for multiple columns to be in view at once when reading from a horizontal roll, it would be possible to time rolling over a first column while reading a second column to reveal a third column, and so on. 

This roll book was the interface for bible users of early antiquity. As I mentioned above, the reading of scripture in the synagogue of Luke 4 portrays the use of this roll interface for bible. If we read the 2nd letter to Timothy attributed to Paul the apostle, we see an explicit mention of his use of rolls as Timothy is asked to bring the rolls (biblia), especially the parchments. Vast material manuscript evidence from Qumran and Cairo Geniza and Oxyryncus all provide examples of bible as roll. What relationship with text might this roll offer users of bible? The linear access to text offers a spatial sense of where each portion of text is in relationship to the whole. In fact, a user has to physically pass through the whole to get to any part and the rolls in each hand get bigger and smaller, providing a visual cue as to how close a user is to one end or the other. Perhaps this interface influences the rabbinic exegetical notion of all parts must be read in relationship to the whole (WHAT IS THE TECHNICAL TERM FOR THIS). This does not mean that all of the content of bible had to be in one roll and it certainly was not at this stage of development. We have evidence of bible rolls containing one single writing only, such as the Isaiah roll found at Qumran. Other bible rolls contain combinations of writings, such as the Torah scroll that contains the first five writings of the Hebrew scriptures together in one roll. Theoretically, the length of a roll was unbounded, allowing for endless collecting of writings in one interface. Yet, due to usability, it seems that roll lengths stayed limited to at most approximately ?? long. The two handed interface with rolls demanded some limits on scalability, which in turn led to selectivity in collecting writings together in a single interface. 

How might we talk about the Isaiah roll as an interface in ways that might exceed what we imagine when thinking about the Isaiah roll as a container. In fact, we can begin with the name, Isaiah roll. We tend to name these rolls and other book interfaces by the content they contain or even the assumed author of the text. In antiquity, this attribution of authorship is dubious at best given the common practice of pseudepigaphy.^[Give a citation or two for people to explore the role of ]What if we imagined the story told by the text of the roll as only one affordance of the interface that is

### Bible as Interface: Codex Bible ###

This roll interface was the dominant bible interface until near the turn of the first century of the common era, when a different technology for book begins to emerge, the codex. Codex is the antique technical term for book as we know it today. The definition offered by Roberts and Skeat in *The Birth of the Codex*, states that a codex is “a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers.”^[Colin H. Roberts and T. C. Skeat, The Birth of the Codex (London: Oxford University Press, 1983), 1.] This is a helpful and precise definition, which highlights the material mashup that codex represents. The fastening of multiple writing surfaces together at one end so that the writing surfaces fold together, face to face, comes from the wooden tablets commonly used by the Romans in antiquity. This collection of wood frames filled with wax is where codex gets its name, with codae being Latin for wood. In order to be of practical use for longer writings such as literature, poetry, or scripture, a shift was made to the same type of writing and reading surface as the roll, typically papyrus or parchment. So, the codex becomes a mashup of two writing and reading technologies at the time, the wax tablet and the roll. The main structural difference between roll and codex arises from the way in which sheets are attached together. Rather than gluing sheets together at an edge in sequence to make a long continuous roll, a codex is made by folding sheets into bundles called quires and then fastening one or more quires at one long edge. The bare minimum material needed to constitute a codex is more than one sheet of material and some kind of binding at the spine. This new interface, though carrying forward continuities with existing technologies, afforded new user relationships.^[The ancient helpdesk parody video that has circulated on youtube provides a helpful, though hyperbolic, depiction of the assumptions we make about codex as a technology since we are so familiar with it.]

Derived from its ancestors, the wax tablet, the leaf tablet^[See Graham Stanton, Jesus and Gospel (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 174, for a discussion of the leaf tablets found at Vindolanda.] and the notebook, the codex provided a number of potential technological advantages as compared to the roll. Numerous examples have been suggested, such as portability, capacity, and flexibility.^[Cite a few examples of people who list these advantages, Gamble, etc.] For example, Martial’s late first century promotion of the new codex technology as a fitting format for a traveler’s collection of his poems or other literary classics confirms the accepted value of portability attributed to the codex in antiquity.^[Roberts and Skeat, The Birth of the Codex, 24-25. Even with this affordance of portability offered by the codex, this may not have been an important technological advance for bible in early antiquity, since the scriptures used by early Christians were largely still interfaced in roll.] Allowing for writing on both sides of the writing surface, the codex could hold more text per unit of material and thus smaller, more portable books could be produced. On the other hand, since the codex could theoretically bind an unlimited number of pages and both sides of these pages were used for writing, the codex could hold an enormous and unlimited amount of text within one book. This tremendous capacity also allowed for increased collection of writings together in one volume. Yet, as we saw with the roll, the pragmatics of user interaction with interface placed some limit on the practical capacity of a single codex. The flexibility of the codex is confined mostly to the multiquire format, where the binding could be removed to facilitate rearrangement, addition, and subtraction of sections. These advantages of the codex were exploited to different degrees in different times and places.

I agree with James O’Donnell, who suggests that the most valuable technological advantage provided by the codex is non-linear access to text.^[James Joseph O'Donnell, Avatars of the Word: From Papyrus to Cyberspace (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1998), 54, says, "The history of medieval manuscripts is the history of the exploitation of the possibilities of the codex page.”] Non-linear access captures one of the fundamental technical differences between a scroll and a codex. As we described above, the text of a roll has to be accessed in a linear fashion, from beginning to end, even if not all of the text is read. With a codex, access to a text can begin at any point without regard for what precedes or follows, and need not proceed in any sort of linear fashion. I prefer the language of non-linear access to describe this technological innovation over phrases such as “ease of reference” or “random access.” The phrase “ease of reference” does not adequately describe the fundamental transition
in the user interface for text processing that accompanied the shift in technology from roll to codex and traditional reference aids did not become common, even in codices, until the fourth century C.E. Though random access was certainly possible with a codex, this seems like extreme language to describe the phenomenon. Reading and writing processes rarely invlove or necessitate truly random access to a text.^[More recent machine reading techniques such as those used in Natural Language Processing tasks such as topic modeling can involve access to text that approaches randomness.] “Non-linear” terminology maintains the idea of user relating with interface and clearly describes the technological affordance brought about by the codex.

As I have said before, no media transition is total and all new media continues to embody the forms that came before it. One of the fascinating historical coincidences (or is it a coincidence?) of early antiquity is the simultaneous rise of the codex as a dominant literary form and the rise of Christianity. I find it entirely uninteresting to postulate any direct causality in any direction among this relationship, but we have plenty of indicators that books mattered to the early Judeo-Christian milieu and that bible was a hybrid interface for many. One particular 6th century mosaic from Ravenna, Italy demonstrates this hybrid or multimedia interface beautifully. As many have experienced, Ravenna is full of fantastic and curious early depictions of Christian scenes in mosaic form from the 5th and 6th centuries of the common era. What surprised me as I began my reluctant tour through the ancient tourist sites was the prevalence of books in these early art forms. In fact, there were books everywhere, from the rolls in the hands of the saints around the baptismal font to the famous gospel cabinet in the funerary room. In the context of this discussion about bible as interface and the emergence of codex as a new interface, there is one particular depiction of a gospel writer in the cathedral of San Vitale that highlights the copresence of roll and codex in the interface repertoire of ancient bible users. This particular set of mosaics is dated to the 6th century and the wall depicts all four gospel writers with their typical animal signs. The mosaic of Matthew (Check) depicts him sitting near a writing desk with a codex in his lap and a basket of rolls near the foot of the desk. Even as late as the 6th century, when codex has become the dominant reading and writing interface for most users of the world, high Christian iconography is entirely comfortable depicting the use of both roll and codex in the composition of their sacred writings. So, as a user, the gospel writer would have to participate in multiple interfaces in order to compose bible. 

** Add here both Eusebian canons and Hexapla as new interfaces based on the emergence of codex as a technology. 

** Also add here a paragraph on print as basically an extension and consolidation of codex as an interface. No doubt print offered new affordances as an interface, but we can look at these affordances as expansions of the codex that may have shaped even deeper dispositions toward fixicity, stability and comprehensiveness/totality. In fact, I could mention Tim's definition of bible as cultural icon here as a product of print affordances. 

Will have to at least mention hurtado here and perhaps I can compare his stats with those of Roberts and skeat, etc.

Here, I'll need to push at least until the Eusebius requested codex bibles of the 4th-5th century. But start closer to my old argument about the intersecting demands of portability, authority, and usefulness as a way of imagining the rise of this medium for book in Christian scripture. 
- again, when do we see this bound collection of scriptural writings referred to as a whole as bible?
- key here is to demonstrate that bible is bound to book (use Tim here and then follow his argument into another media transition. 

I think I will drop the defining bible section and merely begin here, with bible as book. Part of me wants to push all the way back to tablets as bible, but may have to save that for a note somewhere. Instead, here, I will use kugel and others who have traced the history of bible and begin with the biblos in Paul's writings, perhaps. 
- I'd like to know where biblos occurs in LXX and In What contexts
- I'd like to know when/how Jewish scriptures get called bible
- refer to rise of codex business and role of bible from intro 

## Archic Bible

One of the arguments I am promoting here is that a move to consider bible as interface can encourage concepts and practices around books like bible that are anarchic. As I mentioned when introducing anarchy in the last chapter, the tradition of bible had been deeply infused with archic tendencies along the way. 
As indicated by the inerrancy statement, these central texts at the *beginning*
of core biblical writings have shaped biblical interpretation and bible reading 
practices. We can see the influence of this arche on bible reading practices
throughout history and here some examples of archic approaches to bible 

- reformation - return to original languages
- principles guiding the construction of the Nestle-Aland
- Jesus Seminar
- would be interesting to explore the Buber rosenzwrig translation as a problematization of this arche binary. They did promote a return to an original as the governing principle, but this return was to speech and sound. Here again we have a levinasian theme emerge around the difference between speech and both writing and seeing. In his Jewish sensibility sound has a way of eluding mastery that is much more difficult with sight and words.


### Apostolicity in Canon Discussions

Though our awareness of the complicated history of canon consciousness is growing, one place we can see the reign of an original in the production of bible is in the conversations around acceptable scriptures and canon in early Christian communities.[^Recall my brief explanation of the difference between scripture and bible as I use them here. Scripture is a broader category that denotes a writing that is deemed authoritative for a particular religious community (Wimbush 2008 - Theorizing Scriptures, ??). Bible is a specific expression of scripture by Judeo-Christians traditions and denotes a collection of authoritative writings in a book for use by a particular community.] As noted in other places, I am more interested here in the *process* of evaluation of writings that should or should not be considered as bible than in any final or definitive product. One of the common criteria we find used by early Christian church communities to decide whether to consider a writing as scripture is apostolicity. 

For a writing to be apostolic, it had to be written by an apostle or by a near associate of an apostle. For example, in his 39th Festal Letter in the year 362, often considered the earliest full list of the 27 New Testament writings as we have them in contemporary versions of bible, Athanasius follows the archaeological historical method of the Gospel according to Luke and says, 
> It being my intention to mention these matters, I shall, for the commendation of my venture, follow the example of the evangelist Luke and say [cf. Luke 1:1-4]: Since some have taken in hand to set in order for themselves the so-called apocrypha and to mingle them with the God-inspired scripture, concerning which we have attained to a sure persuasion, according to what the original eye-witness and ministers of the word have delivered unto our fathers, I also, having been urged by true brethren and having investigated the matter from the beginning, have decided to set forth in order the writings that have been put in the canon, that have been handed down and confirmed as divine, in order that every one who has been led astray may condemn his seducers, and that every one who has remained stainless may rejoice, being again reminded of that (Cite traditional translation).
There are two archic moments worth mentioning in this early witness to the discussions around writings deemed "God-inspired scripture." Athanasius sets up his listing as that which is handed down from the "original eye-witness and ministers of the word have delivered unto our fathers." This is a direct statement of the apostolic criterion, writings which originate from the direct teaching of Jesus through the authorship of original eye-witnesses. There is a positive correlation in this tradition between the arche and logos of John 1:1 and the impulse to use the origin of Jesus's words passed down through his apostles as a governing criteria for deciding what constitutes bible. The second archic moment is found in the statement of historical method borrowed from the Gospel according to Luke, "Having investigated the matter from the beginning." Here again we find recourse to a beginning or origin as the governing principle for determining what is meaningful. 

Now, as Harry Gamble and Lee Martin McDonald have highlighted, the canonization process is and has always been complicated and the archic impulse of the criterion of apostolicity was not sufficient alone for consideration nor was it the only variable operative in these conversations (Gamble 1985, ; McDonald 2002, ). Yet, some of the other criteria also lend themselves to the archic impulse, governed by an origin or a singular principle, such as antiquity (earliest writings) and orthodoxy (fits accepted principles of faith).

Interestingly, the majority of writings considered for this category come from the first or second century of the common era (criteria of antiquity) and have no internal identification of authorship at all, they are anonymous or even pseudepigraphic.[^List here the writings that have textual authorial identification, those that do not, and those considered pseudepigraphic with a citation for more info on pseudepigraphy.] Thus, considerations of authorship by early Christian communities were based on passed down tradition about the origin of these writings as much as the writings themselves.

## reimagining bible ##

Taking a very different approach, Tim Beal in *The Rise and Fall of the Bible*, also raises some questions that challenge the cultural notions of bible and book. Driven in part by a curiosity around the continued rise in bible production and sales alongside what seems to be a decline in biblical literacy in America (QUOTE), Beal questions our typical ingrained notions of the relationship between literary production and consumption. He suggests that the meaning and value of the bible in America may have little to do with the accessibility and relevance of the texts inside these books that carry on the ancient manuscript tradition. Instead, it is the cultural iconicity of the bible that generates its value and meaning. Perhaps this cultural iconicity is akin to the reality principle that Baudrillard talks about in Disneyland? People buy bibles not because they actually think they will find some original meaning in these ancient texts that will be relevant to their contemporary life, but because the cultural idea of bible offers a promise that "truth" or "reality" still exist. 

No doubt, Beal is on to something when he suggests that this cultural idea of bible as a locus of singular and univocal truth is bound up in the codex technologies that came to hold in one volume the entire libraries that constituted the various community collections that were called scrolls but came to be know as bible (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location, 2032-46). In so far as this cultural idea of bible prevails, the bible as stable truth or "the real," the cultural value of the bible is married to the the cultural vlaue placed on the codex. Yet, the codex is losing its grip on the reality principle with the advent of e-books, cloud collections, and searchability that gives us new "books" made up of fragments from many sources and with little regard for their location in their "original" narratives. How will the cultural iconicity of the bible fare in this new marketplace?

Like Parker, Beal too problematizes the dominant conception of the bible as a singular book with a stable original. Interestingly, both authors make this argument using the cultural capital valued in the bible context, antiquity, which can easily slide into a sense of recovering an original. Nonetheless, Beal describes the early manuscript tradition of the bible as a collection of texts from many sources and many contexts that "were not the same from copy to copy. There was no beginning and no end to them, no first and last page. They did not have one author or one voice. They were not read in a linear way, but they were read around in. And they grew through interpretation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2046). Beal offers this imagination of the bible as a multivocal, polyvalent and dynamic library to challenge the doxa of the bible as "the literal Word of God and closed book of answers" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2032). Just before this quote, Beal suggests that this cultural imagination of bible as reality principle is already dead, so he goes on to articulate an alternative imagination of the bible as "a space that hosts accidental revelation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location 2060), an infinite cycle of production littered with intrigue and surprise as meaning is made in practice.

Some more specifics on book in particular and the growing cultural transition of book beyond the medium of codex.

## Bible as Interface

In this time of media transition for book, thus for bible as well, our theory of interface embedded in a framework of proximity as the increase of both nearness and distance paves a way for bible to transform along with the cultural artifact that gave it its name. 
Interface is this space of 'relationship with.' It is the relationship with books, the discourse of reading, that constitutes the religious sentiment for Levinas, not only the books themselves.

## What is Bible? ##

Walk through concept of bible here from Greek word for scroll to early concepts of Judeo-Christian scripture to Tim Beal's bible as cultural icon.  In one sense, bible is a collection of writings that function as scripture for a Jewish of Christian community. Scripture denotes, in this case, a writing that has significant religious value for a community. Religious values are... 

Taking seriously the material scripture movement, I will talk more narrowly about bible as a material artifact that is utterly bound up in books, as Levinas so nicely suggests for us above. 



## Anarchic bible ##

I wonder if the technological affordance of non linear access offered by the codex itself was already a hint in the direction of anarchy? Materially, the roll depended on the beginning and the end of a text and a particular directionality of access. With the advent of the codex, the role of the beginning of a text needn't play the same grounding role, technologically. This could provide a concrete material illustration of the kind of anarchy I am espousing. A codex most definitely still has a beginning, yet the beginning need no longer govern the reading experience, since a reader can enter into the text at any point.
