### bible as book of books (Levinas)

The transcripts of these interviews were my introduction to the ideas, thought, and methodology of Levinas and as I continue to encounter more of his work, I come back to these interviews and hear them with deeper resonance and richness each time. If anyone were to question why a bible project like *a proximate bible* would be so interested in a continental philosopher such as Levinas, even a cursory glance at these interviews would clarify. In the first question of the first interview transcribed in *Ethics and Infinity*, which is titled 'Bible and Philosophy,' Levinas connects thinking to reading books as a 'modality' of humanness and suggests that for him, the Bible is 'the book par excellence' (Cohen translating Levinas, *Ethics and Infinity*, 22). The conversation continues toward questions about the relationship between bible, philosophical writings and the Russian literary classics. At one point, Nemo asks Levinas about the ways he has 'harmonized' biblical and philosophical thinking, to which Levinas responds:


(Cohen translating Levinas, *EI*, 23)

A close read of this response could take us on a journey through much of Levinas's philosophical ideas, but we will focus on just a few echoes. What we will find is that bible and the process of reading it encourages, provides an interface with religion, thus with the face of the other. The bookishness he mentions in his initial response to Nemo about where thinking begins now gets wrapped into what Levinas calls 'the religious sentiment.' We have to remember here that Levinas often uses words in ways that are unfamiliar. Curiously, I have been working with this passage for several years and it wasn't until just recently that the role of religion gained amplitude. My contentious background as an evangelically trained biblical exegete always drew me toward his correlation of mystery, possibility, exegesis, and transcendence in the underlined section above. I hadn't even taken the time to consider this response as an articulation of Levinas's theory of religion, or at least a statement about the practices that stimulated his religious imagination.

Spending so much of my time thinking about the role of book technologies in religious identity, I have often missed the importance of the '*relationship with* books' in this discussion of bible. If we follow this passage further, we find this *relationship* with books restated in the commentators, the hermeneutic glimpsing, and the place of interpretation. It is not bible as a recipe book for determinate beliefs that signaled transcendence, rather the possibilities found in its infinite process of reading as meaning making. This process of reading as meaning, interpretation, Levinas suggests bible and philosophy may have in common.

Interface is this space of 'relationship with.' It is the relationship with books, the discourse of reading, that constitutes the religious sentiment for Levinas, not only the books themselves.
