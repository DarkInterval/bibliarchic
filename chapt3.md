We have now considered interface as a way of thinking about our relationship with books. We have articulated a multilayered theory of interface based on Levinasian proximity that accounts for the entangled interfaces of human-machines-human. Now, we can turn to bible and explore how this proximate theory of interface might help us imagine bible as interface. Why focus on bible as interface here and not some other literary tradition that has had a lasting impact on culture? One of the reasons I ever began considering proximity as a way of describing our relationship with bible was due to a moment in Philip Nemo's interviews with Levinas that hinted at the deep role bible had played in the development of his philosophical thinking. 

## Book of Books ##

The transcripts of the 197? radio conversations between Nemo and Levinas near the end of his writing career were my introduction to the ideas, thought, and methodology of Levinas and as I continue to encounter more of his work, I come back to these interviews and hear them with deeper resonance and richness each time (Cohen and Levinas, EI). In the first question of the first interview transcribed in *Ethics and Infinity*, which is titled 'Bible and Philosophy,' Levinas articulates the deep value of reading and the special role of bible in his approach to philosophy, saying,

> I think that in the great fear of bookishness, one underestimates the "ontological" reference of the human to the book that one takes for a source of information, or for a "tool" of learning, a *textbook*, even though it is a *modality* of our being...In this sense the Bible would be for me the book par excellence (Cohen translating Levinas, *Ethics and Infinity*, 3-4).

I read here a philosophically veiled articulation of the argument we have been exploring all along, the difference between book as container and book as interface. Levinas suggests that our relationship with books, "bookishness," is far more than simply a content delivery and consumption mechanism and even exceeds the pursuit of knowledge. These two "ontological" concepts of book, consumption of content and the pursuit of knowledge, he caricatures with the image of a textbook, a container par excellence. This view of book as container sounds eerily similar to the dangerous essence of technology that Heidegger cautions against in QCT, which makes all things into a store of information.^[See Chapter 2.] Alternatively, Levinas suggests that our relationship with books, which he calls reading and I call use, is not like a textbook, but instead is "a modality of our being," with Bible as "the book par excellence." The historic relationship Jews have had with the Bible demonstrates for Levinas this modality of being in reading that is not reducible to the consumption of content. He says, 

> The sentiment that the Bible is the Book of books wherein the first things are said, those that *became* said so that human life has a meaning, and are said in a form which opens to commentators the same dimension of profundity, was not some simple substitution of a literary judgment onto the consciousness of the "sacred." It is that extraordinary presence of its characters, that ethical plenitude and its mysterious possibilities of exegesis which originally signified transcendence for me. And no less (Cohen translating Levinas, *EI*, 23).

A close read of this response could take us on a journey through much of Levinas's philosophical ideas, but we will focus on just a few pieces that illustrate bible as a book that is something exceeding a container of content. Similar to what we saw with his reflections on Paul Celan's poetry as a language of and for proximity, Levinas offers us a concept of bible that signals the encounter with the face (a synonym for the notion of proximity we built in the last chapter). Describing the nature of encounter with the Bible, Levinas says, “For us, the world of the Bible is a world not of figures, but of faces.”^[Emmanuel Levinas, *Difficult Freedom: Essays on Judaism* (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), 140.] In what way does encounter with the Bible constitute encounter with faces? Is this a reference to the faces of the many people in the stories of the Bible or even the faces of those who have read and passed on the traditions surrounding the Bible? The Bible is face even before the stories and their long tradition of interpretation are known. Before becoming a document, regardless of the specific content within, bible as book demands a reading process that performs proximity.^[Emmanuel Levinas, “On the Jewish Reading of Scriptures,” in Levinas and Biblical Studies, eds. Tamara Cohn Eskanazi, Gary A. Philips and David Jobling (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2003), 27.] The overflow of potential meaning in the smallest lexical units of the biblical texts defies containment just as proximity maintains a relationship that increases both nearness (responsibility) and distance (otherness).

The "ethical plenitude" and "extraordinary presence" Levinas attributes to the bible can be taken as synonyms for the nearness and distance of proximity, respectively. Ethical plenitude refers not to an abundantly recurring theme of ethics in the content of the biblical writings, but to a relationship of approach in reading that inexhaustibly demands a response. This ethics is a process of reading that opens to "mysterious possibilities of exegesis" not a prescriptive content to be consumed. The extraordinary presence of the biblical characters is not a celebration of the great cloud of witnesses in the biblical stories. Rather, these characters are the very letters of the text before they are assembled into words and phrases. These characters appear ("presence") in ways that are beyond the ordinary, such that they remain at a distance, irreducible to the semiotic performance of their combinatorial effects. Proximately, the characters of the bible provide a relationship in reading that can be characterized by contact without grasp, a reading that opens to "mysterious possibilities of exegesis."^[In his reflections on revelation in the Jewish tradition, Levinas, *Beyond the Verse*, 132, suggests, "It is by going back to the Hebrew text from the translations, vulnerable as they may be, that the strange or mysterious ambiguity or polysemy authorized by the Hebrew syntax is revealed: words coexist rather than immediately being co-ordinated or subordinated with and to one another, contrary to what is predominant in the languages that are said to be developed or functional. This coexistence of words before and irreducible to their coordination is the extraordinary presence of the characters of the bible.] 

These reflections from Levinas on the role of bible as book beyond and before the content of the stories it contains have played an important role in developing my approach to bible as a proximate interface, a space of encounter that demands a response (near) and resists mastery (distant). Our current media landscape has brought the concept of interface to the fore and given us a chance to reflect on the usefulness of interface as a way to think about bible. Yet, bible has been an interface for its entire history. A look at the relationship of users with bible throughout history will demonstrate that considering bible as interface is not a break with tradition, but a kind of translation of it. As we noted in chapter one, interface does not simply indicate a tool used to achieve a particular aim. Interface describes a relationship of a user with a book that exceeds the simple delivery of content for consumption. Let us look at some examples of this relationship throughout the media lives of bible. 

I wonder if I should go back to introducing affordances here as a way to look at the relationship of user with interface, a relationship which also constitutes the process of interface. I could explain affordances as the entangled materialities that construct the space of interface and then walk through the interface history of the bible as book looking for a few specific affordances, such as non-linear access, atomization, and aggregation/collection. Or I could simply describe each interface in terms of its affordances. Roll affords continuous access to text with reinforced sense of relationships of part to whole. Unlike our contemporary romance novels, it would be an onerous task to peek at the end of a story with this roll interface. Roll offers protection of writings and a kind of focus on a particular portion of text by only exposing bits of the text at a time to the user. In the end, I am deciding to stick to one notion of interface, user with platform, rather than push toward the multilayered interface of user-platform-user. 

## Interfacing Bible as Book ##

On of the key things to remember as we explore the many interfaces of bible throughout history is that these interfaces all borrow from each other and media transitions are never total. Early Christian art provides wonderful examples of the role of books in 
Introduce the Ravenna mosaic as an introduction to the history 

Before bible became Bible, it was book. Our concept of book has become so deeply entangled with the dominant book technology of nearly the last two millennia, the codex, that we forget that book has not always been codex. Depending on how broadly we want to define book and its relationship to writing, we could imagine book going all the way back to cave walls and stone tablets. I won't take us all the way down that road here to avoid the detours it might provide, but in the life of bible as book, it is at least important to consider the codexes immediate technological ancestor, the roll.^[as a future project, I would like to come back to this point and explore the relationship between the two tablets of exodus and the evolution of bible as cultural icon as Tim beal describes (total, closed, authoritative, etc.). I would start with William blakes plates of Moses with the tablets looking just like a coded.] The roll was the most common book format for literature and religious texts from ???? to ???? C.E. We find roll books mentioned by authors in the ancient world and in the bible itself. The book mentioned in Nehemiah at the rededication of the temple was most likely a MEGILLA, a BIBLION, a book. Rolls were regularly used in early gatherings for worship in communities that came to be known as Jewish. As an example, the scriptures mentioned in the gospel of Luke, from which Jesus read was a roll.^[Timothy Beal, *Rise and Fall of the Bible*, offers a detailed look at this scene in the gospel of Luke and the way Jesus would have used the roll as an interface for reading. It is an excellent reminder that books and bibles have not always been in codex form.] 

As an interface, the roll offers a two handed user experience when reading that combines the analog, a continuity, and the digital, discrete bits. The typical roll book consists of several sheets of papyrus or parchment, glued together from edge to edge, written on one side in columnar fashion and rolled up for easy storage and protection. To read, a user would use one hand to unroll in the direction of reading, right to left in Hebrew, left to write in Greek, and the other hand to reroll the read portions of the text. A more contemporary, but already out of date, technology that emulates the mechanics of a roll is a cassette tape. If you can imagine rolling the two spools of a cassette tape by hand and reading for text on the tape, that is similar to how users interfaced with the roll. In fact, some rolls had handles that functioned like spools to enable the user to more easily move back and forth through the book. Imagine the inefficiency and frustration in this interface. Once you get to the end of a roll book, a user has to unroll (or is it reroll?) all the way back to the beginning to read again. I can imagine an ancient library staffing a circulation station with aspiring student scribes or scholars, where their only task was to roll back books from end to beginning after they had been used by a patron. Perhaps one of the reasons we find author attribution and colophon at the end of ancient roll manuscripts is because users often didn't rewind. 

The columns of writing in a roll book effectively deliniated what we would call pages today as a user would roll with both hands in concert until a single column or maybe a few columns of text were visible, they would read that column, and then would roll again when ready to move on. In this sense, roll as interface offered the user both a linear analog^[I would rather find other words to describe this difference rather than analog/digital. The important point to make in all interface analysis is that rarely do we have a binary situation because interfaces as relationships afford more than one type of use.] experience of rolling through the trajectory of a book along with a kind of digital processing of the discrete bits of text encountered column by column. Unlike a cassette tape, but much like the page turn of the codex, rolling to expose one or a few columns of text at a time breaks up the experience of a text, even if only for a second. This horizontal roll was not the only interface available for reading and writing use in antiquity, it was simply the preferred interface for longer texts and became the dominant roll book form for Israelite scriptures. Shorter decrees, contracts and letters could be found in a vertical arrangement with the rolling mechanism the same as the horizontal roll, but in a different orientation and the writing was continuous along the roll, rather than being written in discrete columns. With the absence of the columnar interruptions, the vertical roll provided a more continuous reading experience for the user than the horizontal roll.^[This vertical roll interface is akin to our contemporary relationship with reading on a web page, but with significant differences I will point out later when we consider the internet as an interface of bible.] Yet, if a user allowed for multiple columns to be in view at once when reading from a horizontal roll, it would be possible to time rolling over a first column while reading a second column to reveal a third column, and so on. 

This roll book was the interface for bible users of early antiquity. As I mentioned above, the reading of scripture in the synagogue of Luke 4 portrays the use of this roll interface for bible. If we read the 2nd letter to Timothy attributed to Paul the apostle, we see an explicit mention of his use of rolls as Timothy is asked to bring the rolls (biblia), especially the parchments. Vast material manuscript evidence from Qumran and Cairo Geniza and Oxyryncus all provide examples of bible as roll. What relationship with text might this roll offer users of bible? The linear access to text offers a spatial sense of where each portion of text is in relationship to the whole. In fact, a user has to physically pass through the whole to get to any part and the rolls in each hand get bigger and smaller, providing a visual cue as to how close a user is to one end or the other. Perhaps this interface influences the rabbinic exegetical notion of all parts must be read in relationship to the whole (WHAT IS THE TECHNICAL TERM FOR THIS). This does not mean that all of the content of bible had to be in one roll and it certainly was not at this stage of development. We have evidence of bible rolls containing one single writing only, such as the Isaiah roll found at Qumran. Other bible rolls contain combinations of writings, such as the Torah scroll that contains the first five writings of the Hebrew scriptures together in one roll. Theoretically, the length of a roll was unbounded, allowing for endless collecting of writings in one interface. Yet, due to usability, it seems that roll lengths stayed limited to at most approximately ?? long. The two handed interface with rolls demanded some limits on scalability, which in turn led to selectivity in collecting writings together in a single interface. 

### a new medium emerges ###

This roll interface was the dominant bible interface until near the turn of the first century of the common era, when a different technology for book begins to emerge, the codex. Codex is the antique technical term for book as we know it today. The definition offered by Roberts and Skeat in *The Birth of the Codex*, states that a codex is “a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers.”^[Colin H. Roberts and T. C. Skeat, The Birth of the Codex (London: Oxford University Press, 1983), 1.] This is a helpful and precise definition, which clearly differentiates the codex materially from its predecessors. Made of the same type of materials as the roll, papyrus or parchment typically, the main manufacturing difference arises from the way in which sheets are attached together. Rather than gluing sheets together at an edge in sequence, a codex is made by folding sheets into bundles called quires and then fastening one or more quires at one long edge. The bare minimum material needed to constitute a codex is more than one sheet of material and some kind of binding at the spine. This new interface afforded new user relationships.^[The ancient helpdesk parody video that has circulated on youtube provides a helpful, though hyperbolic, depiction of the assumptions we make about codex as a technology since we are so familiar with it.]

Derived from its ancestors, the wax tablet, the leaf tablet^[See Graham Stanton, Jesus and Gospel (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 174, for a discussion of the leaf tablets found at Vindolanda.] and the notebook, the codex provided a number of potential technological advantages as compared to the scroll. Numerous examples have been suggested, such as portability, capacity, and flexibility.^[Cite a few examples of people who list these advantages, Gamble, etc.] For example, Martial’s late first century promotion of the new codex technology as a fitting format for a traveler’s collection of his poems or other literary classics confirms the accepted value of portability attributed to the codex in antiquity.^[Roberts and Skeat, The Birth of the Codex, 24-25. Even with this affordance of portability offered by the codex, this may not have been an important technological advance for bible in early antiquity, since the scriptures used by early Christians were largely still interfaced in roll.] Allowing for writing on both sides of the writing surface, the codex could hold more text per unit of material and thus smaller, more portable books could be produced. On the other hand, since the codex could theoretically bind an unlimited number of pages and both sides of these pages were used for writing, the codex could hold an enormous and unlimited amount of text within one book. This tremendous capacity also allowed for increased collection of writings together in one volume. Yet, as we saw with the roll, the pragmatics of user interaction with interface placed some limit on the practical capacity of a single codex. The flexibility of the codex is confined mostly to the multiquire format, where the binding could be removed to facilitate rearrangement, addition, and subtraction of sections. These advantages of the codex were exploited to different degrees in different times and places.

I agree with James O’Donnell, who suggests that the most valuable technological advantage provided by the codex is non-linear access to text.^[James Joseph O'Donnell, Avatars of the Word: From Papyrus to Cyberspace (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1998), 54, says, "The history of medieval manuscripts is the history of the exploitation of the possibilities of the codex page.”] Non-linear access captures one of the fundamental technical differences between a scroll and a codex. As we described above, the text of a roll has to be accessed in a linear fashion, from beginning to end, even if not all of the text is read. With a codex, access to a text can begin at any point without regard for what precedes or follows, and need not proceed in any sort of linear fashion. I prefer the language of non-linear access to describe this technological innovation over phrases such as “ease of reference” or “random access.” The phrase “ease of reference” does not adequately describe the fundamental transition
in the user interface for text processing that accompanied the shift in technology from roll to codex and traditional reference aids did not become common, even in codices, until the fourth century C.E. Though random access was certainly possible with a codex, this seems like extreme language to describe the phenomenon. Reading and writing processes rarely invlove or necessitate truly random access to a text. “Non-linear” terminology maintains the idea of user relating with interface and clearly describes the technological affordance brought about by the codex.

As I have said before, no media transition is total and all new media continues to embody the forms that came before it. One of the fascinating historical coincidences (or is it a coincidence?) of early antiquity is the simultaneous rise of the codex as a dominant literary form and the rise of Christianity. I find it entirely uninteresting to postulate any direct causality in any direction among this relationship, but we have plenty of indicators that books mattered to the early Judeo-Christian milieu and that bible was a hybrid interface for many. One particular 6th century mosaic from Ravenna, Italy demonstrates this hybrid or multimedia interface beautifully. As many have experienced, Ravenna is full of fantastic and curious early depictions of Christian scenes in mosaic form from the 5th and 6th centuries of the common era. What surprised me as I began my reluctant tour through the ancient tourist sites was the prevalence of books in these early art forms. In fact, there were books everywhere, from the rolls in the hands of the saints around the baptismal font to the famous gospel cabinet in the funerary room. In the context of this discussion about bible as interface and the emergence of codex as a new interface, there is one particular depiction of a gospel writer in the cathedral of San Vitale that highlights the copresence of roll and codex in the interface repertoire of ancient bible users. This particular set of mosaics is dated to the 6th century and the wall depicts all four gospel writers with their typical animal signs. The mosaic of Matthew (Check) depicts him sitting near a writing desk with a codex in his lap and a basket of rolls near the foot of the desk. Even as late as the 6th century, when codex has become the dominant reading and writing interface for most of the world, high Christian iconography is entirely comfortable depicting the use of both roll and codex in the composition of their sacred writings. 

Will have to at least mention hurtado here and perhaps I can compare his stats with those of Roberts and skeat, etc.

Here, I'll need to push at least until the Eusebius requested codex bibles of the 4th-5th century. But start closer to my old argument about the intersecting demands of portability, authority, and usefulness as a way of imagining the rise of this medium for book in Christian scripture. 
- again, when do we see this bound collection of scriptural writings referred to as a whole as bible?
- key here is to demonstrate that bible is bound to book (use Tim here and then follow his argument into another media transition. 

I think I will drop the defining bible section and merely begin here, with bible as book. Part of me wants to push all the way back to tablets as bible, but may have to save that for a note somewhere. Instead, here, I will use kugel and others who have traced the history of bible and begin with the biblos in Paul's writings, perhaps. 
- I'd like to know where biblos occurs in LXX and In What contexts
- I'd like to know when/how Jewish scriptures get called bible
- refer to rise of codex business and role of bible from intro 

## Archic Bible

One of the arguments I am promoting here is that a move to consider bible as interface can encourage concepts and practices around books like bible that are anarchic. As I mentioned when introducing anarchy in the last chapter, the tradition of bible had been deeply infused with archic tendencies along the way. 
As indicated by the inerrancy statement, these central texts at the *beginning*
of core biblical writings have shaped biblical interpretation and bible reading 
practices. We can see the influence of this arche on bible reading practices
throughout history and here some examples of archic approaches to bible 

- reformation - return to original languages
- principles guiding the construction of the Nestle-Aland
- Jesus Seminar
- would be interesting to explore the Buber rosenzwrig translation as a problematization of this arche binary. They did promote a return to an original as the governing principle, but this return was to speech and sound. Here again we have a levinasian theme emerge around the difference between speech and both writing and seeing. In his Jewish sensibility sound has a way of eluding mastery that is much more difficult with sight and words.


### Apostolicity in Canon Discussions

Though our awareness of the complicated history of canon consciousness is growing, one place we can see the reign of an original in the production of bible is in the conversations around acceptable scriptures and canon in early Christian communities.[^Recall my brief explanation of the difference between scripture and bible as I use them here. Scripture is a broader category that denotes a writing that is deemed authoritative for a particular religious community (Wimbush 2008 - Theorizing Scriptures, ??). Bible is a specific expression of scripture by Judeo-Christians traditions and denotes a collection of authoritative writings in a book for use by a particular community.] As noted in other places, I am more interested here in the *process* of evaluation of writings that should or should not be considered as bible than in any final or definitive product. One of the common criteria we find used by early Christian church communities to decide whether to consider a writing as scripture is apostolicity. 

For a writing to be apostolic, it had to be written by an apostle or by a near associate of an apostle. For example, in his 39th Festal Letter in the year 362, often considered the earliest full list of the 27 New Testament writings as we have them in contemporary versions of bible, Athanasius follows the archaeological historical method of the Gospel according to Luke and says, 
> It being my intention to mention these matters, I shall, for the commendation of my venture, follow the example of the evangelist Luke and say [cf. Luke 1:1-4]: Since some have taken in hand to set in order for themselves the so-called apocrypha and to mingle them with the God-inspired scripture, concerning which we have attained to a sure persuasion, according to what the original eye-witness and ministers of the word have delivered unto our fathers, I also, having been urged by true brethren and having investigated the matter from the beginning, have decided to set forth in order the writings that have been put in the canon, that have been handed down and confirmed as divine, in order that every one who has been led astray may condemn his seducers, and that every one who has remained stainless may rejoice, being again reminded of that (Cite traditional translation).
There are two archic moments worth mentioning in this early witness to the discussions around writings deemed "God-inspired scripture." Athanasius sets up his listing as that which is handed down from the "original eye-witness and ministers of the word have delivered unto our fathers." This is a direct statement of the apostolic criterion, writings which originate from the direct teaching of Jesus through the authorship of original eye-witnesses. There is a positive correlation in this tradition between the arche and logos of John 1:1 and the impulse to use the origin of Jesus's words passed down through his apostles as a governing criteria for deciding what constitutes bible. The second archic moment is found in the statement of historical method borrowed from the Gospel according to Luke, "Having investigated the matter from the beginning." Here again we find recourse to a beginning or origin as the governing principle for determining what is meaningful. 

Now, as Harry Gamble and Lee Martin McDonald have highlighted, the canonization process is and has always been complicated and the archic impulse of the criterion of apostolicity was not sufficient alone for consideration nor was it the only variable operative in these conversations (Gamble 1985, ; McDonald 2002, ). Yet, some of the other criteria also lend themselves to the archic impulse, governed by an origin or a singular principle, such as antiquity (earliest writings) and orthodoxy (fits accepted principles of faith).

Interestingly, the majority of writings considered for this category come from the first or second century of the common era (criteria of antiquity) and have no internal identification of authorship at all, they are anonymous or even pseudepigraphic.[^List here the writings that have textual authorial identification, those that do not, and those considered pseudepigraphic with a citation for more info on pseudepigraphy.] Thus, considerations of authorship by early Christian communities were based on passed down tradition about the origin of these writings as much as the writings themselves.

## reimagining bible ##

Taking a very different approach, Tim Beal in *The Rise and Fall of the Bible*, also raises some questions that challenge the cultural notions of bible and book. Driven in part by a curiosity around the continued rise in bible production and sales alongside what seems to be a decline in biblical literacy in America (QUOTE), Beal questions our typical ingrained notions of the relationship between literary production and consumption. He suggests that the meaning and value of the bible in America may have little to do with the accessibility and relevance of the texts inside these books that carry on the ancient manuscript tradition. Instead, it is the cultural iconicity of the bible that generates its value and meaning. Perhaps this cultural iconicity is akin to the reality principle that Baudrillard talks about in Disneyland? People buy bibles not because they actually think they will find some original meaning in these ancient texts that will be relevant to their contemporary life, but because the cultural idea of bible offers a promise that "truth" or "reality" still exist. 

No doubt, Beal is on to something when he suggests that this cultural idea of bible as a locus of singular and univocal truth is bound up in the codex technologies that came to hold in one volume the entire libraries that constituted the various community collections that were called scrolls but came to be know as bible (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location, 2032-46). In so far as this cultural idea of bible prevails, the bible as stable truth or "the real," the cultural value of the bible is married to the the cultural vlaue placed on the codex. Yet, the codex is losing its grip on the reality principle with the advent of e-books, cloud collections, and searchability that gives us new "books" made up of fragments from many sources and with little regard for their location in their "original" narratives. How will the cultural iconicity of the bible fare in this new marketplace?

Like Parker, Beal too problematizes the dominant conception of the bible as a singular book with a stable original. Interestingly, both authors make this argument using the cultural capital valued in the bible context, antiquity, which can easily slide into a sense of recovering an original. Nonetheless, Beal describes the early manuscript tradition of the bible as a collection of texts from many sources and many contexts that "were not the same from copy to copy. There was no beginning and no end to them, no first and last page. They did not have one author or one voice. They were not read in a linear way, but they were read around in. And they grew through interpretation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2046). Beal offers this imagination of the bible as a multivocal, polyvalent and dynamic library to challenge the doxa of the bible as "the literal Word of God and closed book of answers" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2032). Just before this quote, Beal suggests that this cultural imagination of bible as reality principle is already dead, so he goes on to articulate an alternative imagination of the bible as "a space that hosts accidental revelation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location 2060), an infinite cycle of production littered with intrigue and surprise as meaning is made in practice.

Some more specifics on book in particular and the growing cultural transition of book beyond the medium of codex.

## Bible as Interface

In this time of media transition for book, thus for bible as well, our theory of interface embedded in a framework of proximity as the increase of both nearness and distance paves a way for bible to transform along with the cultural artifact that gave it its name. 
Interface is this space of 'relationship with.' It is the relationship with books, the discourse of reading, that constitutes the religious sentiment for Levinas, not only the books themselves.

## What is Bible? ##

Walk through concept of bible here from Greek word for scroll to early concepts of Judeo-Christian scripture to Tim Beal's bible as cultural icon.  In one sense, bible is a collection of writings that function as scripture for a Jewish of Christian community. Scripture denotes, in this case, a writing that has significant religious value for a community. Religious values are... 

Taking seriously the material scripture movement, I will talk more narrowly about bible as a material artifact that is utterly bound up in books, as Levinas so nicely suggests for us above. 



## Anarchic bible ##

I wonder if the technological affordance of non linear access offered by the codex itself was already a hint in the direction of anarchy? Materially, the roll depended on the beginning and the end of a text and a particular directionality of access. With the advent of the codex, the role of the beginning of a text needn't play the same grounding role, technologically. This could provide a concrete material illustration of the kind of anarchy I am espousing. A codex most definitely still has a beginning, yet the beginning need no longer govern the reading experience, since a reader can enter into the text at any point.
