# CHAPTER 2: AFFORDING ANARCHY

Drucker asks humanists to do more theorizing of interface to push design toward principles that take into account the values and practices of the humanities. In this chapter, I take up this call by bringing the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas and particularly his notion of proximity as subjectivity to bear on a theory of interface as space of interaction that demands difference. Drucker's primary concern is to bring the ambiguity of the constructivist subject to bear on the conceptions of reading interfaces in our emerging media landscapes. For her, the concept of subject interrupts the static and over determined operations of user and interface in the software industry. I have already argued for a focus on reader as user, to interrupt our embedded assumptions about the relationship between reader and bible. Even if I do not take up the explicit subject language advocated by Drucker, I follow her lead in exploring how a radically different paradigm of subjectivity might shape our theorizing about interface and even our practices of interface design. 

## Enter Face ##

In the previous chapter, my focus was on the relationship between entities that constitutes interface. In the computing world and in the reading event, the critical relationship is the interface of machine/platform and user. Without forcing any direct equivalence or even analogy, this chapter will shift toward the relationship of humans as a kind of interface that might inform our theory of machine/user interface. My choice to reflect on human/human interface particularly through the lens of Emmanuel Levinas is not accidental. As an instructional technologist, the phrase face to face, a critical piece of Levinasian subjectivity, has come to haunt me. The word 'face' has come to signify human interaction unmediated by digital technologies in the common phrase 'face to face.' There is a great deal of discussion these days about the different values of online/virtual/digital interaction and the so-called 'face to face.' For example, Sherry Turkle has become a prominent public voice in discussions of technology and its social effect, as evidenced in the impressive attention[^16] captured by her new book, *Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age*.[^17] I first encountered Turkle's work while engaging a Richard Cohen article, 'Ethics and Cybernetics: Levinasian Reflections,'[^18] in my struggle with the face to face language in online education. Using her work from 1995, *Life on the Screen*,[^19] Cohen offers Turkle as an example of media scholars who champion the advantages of cybernetics and internet communication technologies for redefining subjectivities in the direction of post-modern notions of multiplicity and instability.[^20]

Turkle's more recent work has shifted focus from this earlier celebration of the fragmented self to a serious anxiety about the effects of robotics and mobile devices on our social capacities as humans.[^21] Two minutes into a 2015 NPR interview titled 'Making the Case For Face to Face in an Era of Digital Conversation,'^22 Turkle suggests that 'face to face conversation is the most human and humanizing thing that we do, it's where we learn to put ourselves in the place of the other.' For many, this phrase, 'face to face,' as Turkle uses it has come to represent 'real' human interaction as opposed to a weak simulation or even cheap imitation that happens through internet media.

Part of why the language of interface compels me is because it can unsettle this binary between digital interfaces and this 'face to face' advocated by Turkle. Conversation over the coffee table and exchanges on Twitter can both be understood as interface and both are mediated by technologies if we understand language as a technology. So, this term, 'interface,' pushes beyond any digital/analog or virtual/real dichotomies and demands that we think about interface design in whatever media we find ourselves using. In a way, we could imagine 'interface,'the intersection of faces, as a useful translation of the phrase 'face to face.'

If we look at the basic uses of 'interface' in the English language, we can see the strong indication of interaction and connection as well as the prevalent use in the computing arena. Here in these definitions,[^23] we can see that the 'face to face' championed by Turkle and others can easily fit into the notion of interface as 'a point where two subjects meet or interact.' When I take up the language of interface, I am not limiting our conversation to digital technologies that afford human interaction with machines. With Drucker, I hope to explore interface as a broader category for spaces of encounter that include many forms of media and mediation.

In all of this, as a strong proponent of the possibility for meaningful human interaction in the emerging media technologies of our day, I became fascinated by the relationship between this "face to face" in common parlance that signaled some kind of unmediated human interaction and was somehow more real and more valuable than other mediated forms of interaction, such as through screens. In my exposure to conversations about teaching and learning in internet spaces, concerns about embodiment and spatial proximity seemed to dominate the anxiety around the possibility for meaningful human interaction online. This exploration of our changing experience and concept of nearness and distance brought about by social media, the internet, and mobile technologies kept surfacing for me a potentially fruitful connection with the troubling of nearness and distance in Levinasian proximity. 

## Proximity as Interface ##

For Drucker, an interface creates a space that allows for a depth of encounter, not simply the contact of a surface. Similarly for Levinas, the face to face creates a space that allows for encounter that holds together nearness and distance, which he calls proximity. I will argue that the proximity of the face in Levinas's philosophy creates something like an interface that affords anarchy. We will use the operations of proximity as interface to guide our explorations of the possibilities for designing reading interfaces that afford anarchy. 

There are two reasons why I bring Levinas's proximity of the face into the conversation of bible as interface at this point. First, Levinas's proximity of the face provides a helpful way to articulate spaces of encounter that encourage a disposition toward anarchy, challenging the reign of the original or fundamental principle. Second, as we trace some possible affinities between proximity and interface, our interface design can be infused with and informed by a philosophy of human relating that is not reducible to that which we can understand or contain.

The concept of proximity has been taken up in the area of internet communication technologies (ICTs) as community has been reconstituted through our ability to interact and relate across vast geographic, temporal, and cultural distances. Lucas Introna offers a nice summary of the common discussions of proximity, distance, and community in his SEP entry on "Phenomenological Approaches to the Ethics of Information Technology" (Introna 2011). A LITTLE MORE HERE ON THEORIES OF ICT and Ethics and Introna's phenomenological approach as it relates to constructivist approach of Drucker...

HAND on Proximity - So the term proximity indicates something excessive for Levinas. It signi fi es a community that exists before any established fact, where the other ’ s singularity is experienced by me as unparalleled, overwhelming, extreme, exclusive and pre-assigned. There is simply no choice in the matter.

-- This excessiveness is highlighted nicely in Ethics as First Philosophy from Hand reader 82-83 - "The proximity of the other is the face's meaning, and it means from the very start in a way that goes beyond those plastic forms which forever try to cover the face like a mask of their presence to perception. But always the face shows through these forms."
-- This is a direct reflection on Introna's discussion of community and proximity in the SEP article. Here, Hand suggests that proximity does indicate a kind of community for Levinas, but not a community dependent upon any pre-existing horizon. I wonder if community here is a helpful term? Here, I think the phrase contact without grasp fits proximity well. Before even our perceptual faculties are constructed in the relational act, there is an encounter that precedes and exceeds my ability to grasp or make sense of or choose it and demands a response, a responsibility, that then provides the conditions of possibility for a relationality. Introna helps greatly in seeing where the notion of proximity may come from Heidegger's notion of disclosure and close at hand. Yet, and critically yet, for Levinas, proximity is not reducible to disclosure or shared horizon. It is contact without grasp or even contact that is being grasped? As Hand suggests, proximity exceeds horizon and disclosure. 

My goal here is to connect the notions of proximity and anarchy in Levinas to interface design that affords reading which is not primarily governed by consuming the content of a container, but encourages a space of interaction that supports difference. Just as Drucker offers probabilistic production as an alternative to mechanical determinism, so here, I will offer the anarchy of proximity as an alternative to consumptive mastery in the practice of reading. Not only does bible offer a zone of encounter for provoking probabilistic production in the practice of reading, but, I argue, bible can be an *anarchic interface*, an interface not governed by a singular original, theme, or principle. Extending Levinas's description of the pre-conscious ethical encounter in the face to face as proximity, I will operationalize this proximity in interface design as a space with depth that opens up possibility for contact without grasp, thus reading not governed by an original (an-arche). 

As I mentioned in the beginning of my chapter on interface, it was in part the simple semantic correlation between inter-face and the face to face in Levinas that raised my curiosity about the possible relationship between the proximity at work in the face to face and bible as interface. One way to parse this process in Levinas's writings is that the face initiates a proximity, a zone of encounter (recall Drucker's discussion of interface) that is both near and distant, which in turn affords anarchic relations, relations not governed by one subject's ability to comprehend, understand, or categorize another subject. So, in the ethical relation, the proximity of the face creates an interface, a particular kind of zone of encounter that demands contact without grasp. Here, I am suggesting a close relationship between the provocation of probabilistic production characteristic of interface and the proximity of the face in the ethical encounter.

For me what matters most in this entire exploration of proximity is its challenge to mastery as the ground for humanness, relationship, and meaning. In proximity, meaning precedes and conditions my mastery of either the physical environment or any other participant in an interface. This is the idea in Levinas's suggestion that even words co-exist before they are coordinated (Beyond the Verse, 130). There is a contact that is not consumption which provides the space of possibility for human connection and interaction, interface. See this quote from Hand -- Levinas’s appreciation of Celan, in contrast, emphasizes the poverty, inadequacy and non-radiance of a language, a language that therefore signifies proximity rather than mastery, and a being for the other rather than a world in being.

Proximity most definitely becomes a critical concept for Levinas as his work evolves. Only occurring about a dozen times in Levinas's first major philosophical work, *Totality and Infinity*, proximity comes to the fore in *Otherwise Than Being*, occurring well over 200 times. From a basic search in the Hand Levinas Reader, we can also see the concept of proximity operative in many of Levinas's writings outside the two major philosophical works. One of these "other" works is his late reflections on the poetry of Paul Celan in "Being and the Other: On Paul Celan" (Levinas 19??). I begin here with Levinas on Celan to make explicit the connections between proximity in Levinas as a response to the dominance of unconcealing in Heidegger's philosophy, which also undergirds Heidegger's famous reflections on the relationship between humans and technology. Sean Hand, in his exquisite reflections on the life and work of Levinas highlights the way in which Levinas sees in Celan a contrast to Heideggerian readings of the poetry of Hölderlin. Hand writes, "Levinas’s appreciation of Celan, in contrast, emphasizes the poverty, inadequacy and non-radiance of a language, a language that therefore signifies proximity rather than mastery, and a being for the other rather than a world in being" (Hand 2008). It is this difference between Levinas and Heidegger that drives the importance of proximity in Levinas's work and this difference between proximity and mastery that draws my reflections on interface toward the work of Levinas.

*** Maybe even something like a narrative numbered list of reasons why Celan matters for this specific project.

There is another important reason why I begin with Levinas on Celan. In most of Levinas's early work, he is clearly focused only on the possibility of the ethical relation among humans. He explicitly argues against things having a face in his early work on art in "Reality and its Shadows." Things simply do not have the dynamism or the vulnerability of the human face and hence do not command, "Thou Shall Not Kill" in the same way. With these later reflections on Celan's poetry as "a language of and for proximity," we begin to see Levinas allow for art to participate in the "otherwise than being" that is his ethical relation. There is a subtle shift here from the philosophical notion of proximity as preceding language to poetry as a kind of language that performs proximity.The role of affordances in interface as we have discussed here could offer a way to imagine how the face might remain a distinctively human phenomenon and yet art may still be able to participate in proximity. Perhaps a book or a painting or a poem, in the case of Celan, or any interface can not be the face of the other since it can not demand the same kind of responsibility. Yet, these interfaces can offer a kind of proximity that conditions a disposition toward the ethical relation? accept that the ethical relation is pre-dispositional, so this last bit doesn't work. 

Proximity appears^[I am aware of the difficult irony of this phrase, since I am arguing for proximity as an alternative to the appearing that is so central to Heidegger's philosophical system.] in Levinas's own reflections on Celan in his essay titled "Being and the Other: On Paul Celan" (Levinas and Melville 1978). In the brief introduction to Levinas's reading of Celan on poetry, we find the contrast between the unveiling aletheia ("truth of Being") in Heidegger and the proximity in Levinas that is responsibility for the other, contact without grasp. Describing his understanding of Celan's view, Levinas writes that poetic language is "A language of and for proximity--more ancient than that of the "truth of Being" (which it probably bears and supports), the first of languages--response preceding question, responsibility to the neighbor--, making possible through its "for the other" the whole miracle of giving (Levinas and Melville 1978, 17). In this simple excerpt from Levinas's reflections on Celan, we see proximity preceding truth and response(ibility) preceding questioning. Here we have the explicit connection Levinas makes between his concept of proximity and Celan's notion of poetic language. Near the end of this essay on Celan, Levinas also suggests that Celan poetry is an "otherwise than Being," which again draws the parallels between his philosophical reflections and Celan's poetic art. 

My task here is not to explicate or argue comprehensively for Levinas's views on poetry, art, or Celan in particular.^[Provide a list of some people who do take up this questions explicitly, beginning with Hand's summary of early and late views of art and then some more specific studies that contrast "Reality and It's Shadows" with "Being and the Other: On Paul Celan." See also ?? and Felstiner on the relationship between the poetic concern about distance/nearness in Celan, the performance of this concern in translation, and Levinas’s articulation of Celan’s poetry as a language of and for proximity - subjectivity irreducible to nearness (appearing in Heideggerian terms).] Instead, I will use the threads in this essay on Celan to frame proximity as a response to the unconcealing that is essential to Heidegger's understanding of human relationship with technology. In particular, "Being and the Other" offers several hints toward the link between proximity and something otherwise than (and containing) the "truth of Being" in Heidegger. Along with his explicit mention of Heidegger on the first page of the essay, Levinas frames Celan's notion of poetic language as not "the shining forth of pre-Socratic '*physis*,'" but as "prior to 'unconcealment,'" a language "more ancient than that of the 'truth of Being,'" and "response preceding question" (Levinas and Melville 1978, 16-17). All four of these concepts, the shining forth of physis, unconcealment, the truth of Being, and the importance of questioning are direct references to Heidegger's philosophical framework. 

Though I could use many of Heidegger's writings to trace the operations of these concepts, I will focus on his famous essay translated into English as "The Question Concerning Technology" (QCT from here on; Heidegger and TRANS 1977). In this context, I choose QCT because I am focused on the technologies of reading as interface and this essay of Heidegger's has been a critical piece of the historical conversation about human relationships with machines. Also, in QCT, Heidegger demonstrates his reading of Hölderlin's poetry toward his philosophy of appearing/revealing, which Levinas is directly contrasting in his reading of Celan's poetry. Truth as a revealing plays a central part in Heidegger's "questioning" of technology and the essay ends with a turn to art and a celebration of "questioning." Finally, Introna's reflections on ethics in internet communication technologies demonstrated the ongoing conversation about our human response to the changes in space and time enacted by the emergence of the internet. It was a similar anxiety about the impact of technologies on our experience of nearness and distance and the potential changes for human relationships that gave rise to Heidegger's Bremen lectures, from which came QCT. So, we see again that my attraction to Levinas and proximity as a way of theorizing interface comes from a persistent occupation with the possibility of meaningful human relationship in our emerging media landscape. 

The core problem Heidegger identifies with technology in QCT is quite related to the concerns I have already discussed in Johanna Drucker's questioning of the mechanistic determinism of interface design in the software industry and my own concerns about common notions of reader as consumer of content in a container. In fact, this concern about the reduction of humans to some kind of deterministic homogeneity provides a thread that connects Drucker's theory of interface, Heidegger's concern about technology, and Levinas's philosophy of proximity. Levinas does not spend much time addressing technology directly, but with the themes (pun intended) operating in Heidegger's QCT as a bridge, I will connect the notion of proximity in Levinas to the concept of interface as space I have built with the help of Drucker's reflections on the role of the humanities in theorizing about interface. 

QCT is a revised version of the second of a four part lecture series Heidegger gave in Bremen in 1949 as his first public address after the war ended (Blitz 2014).^[Blitz 2014 provides a useful exploration of the relationship of QCT to the Bremen lectures and to the larger themes in Heidegger's work.] Heidegger begins the lecture series with a clear statement of the issue he is confronting, saying, "All distances in time and space are shrinking" (2012, 3). The larger lecture series explores the changing relationship between distance and nearness with the rise of modern technologies such as airplanes, radio, film, and television (Heidegger 2012, 3). In a subtle twist of the more well known title of the expanded version of lecture two, "The Question Concerning Technology," the concern in these questions about technology is what happens to the possibility of nearness as difference as technologies afford a kind of distancelessness? (Heidegger 2012, 4). Heidegger will go on to articulate the essence of technology as the process that renders all being, humans and nature included, as distanceless without nearness, thus he begins the second lecture saying, "All mastery of distances brings no nearness at all" (Heidegger 2012, 23). It is worth pointing out again that this problem of the relationship between distance, technology, and the human continues to occupy technology theorists today. These historical philosophical discussions in Heidegger and Levinas still speak loudly to the concerns about intimacy and the digital in Sherry Turkle's work, the questions of community and the internet pursued by Introna, and the role of subject in interface explored by Drucker.^[One of the most explicit expressions of this focus on distance and the human in emerging technologies, particularly related to Levinasian proximity, is Roger Silverstone's suggestion of a "proper distance" as the possibility for ethical/moral human relationships in cyberspace (2003).] As we will see below, proximity in Levinas can be read, in part, as a response to Heidegger's reflections on nearness, distance, and human encounter. 

Now that we have contextualized QCT within the larger Bremen lecture series and the ongoing contemporary discussion about the role of distance and nearness in human relationship in emerging technologies, I will turn to some specific reflections on QCT. Far from a complete analysis of Heidegger's philosophy of technology, I will focus narrowly on how technology as a revealing, as a "truth of Being," can provide a backdrop for the role of proximity in Levinas as a negotiation of this problem of nearness and distance.^[For more exhaustive studies of Heidegger's thinking and writing on technology, Blitz 2014 provides a fantastic introduction and Ihde 2010 offers a thorough contextualization and critique of Heidegger's views.] After a statement of his methodology of questioning, Heidegger combines the example of a silver chalice with a reading of the four Aristotelean causes to suggest that the instrumental definitions of technology are correct, but not true (Heidegger 1977, 4-11). Heidegger agrees that technology as a means to an end most definitely describes our relationship to technologies in some fashion, but that the essence of technology can not be reduced to this instrumentality. After this long analysis, he writes, "Technology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we give heed to this, then another whole realm for the essence of technology will open itself up to us. It is the realm of revealing, i.e., of truth" (Heidegger 1977, 12).^[The translators note to the last word of this quote gives an explanation of the relationship between *Wahrheit* and the *bergen* stem words Heidegger uses to talk about revealing and its related terms (Heidegger 1977, 12, n. 12.). After a short discussion of the etymology of *techne*, Heidegger restates this claim emphatically, saying, "Technology is a mode of revealing. Technology comes to presence [West] in the realm where revealing and unconcealment take place, where *aletheia*, truth, happens."] All of these terms here --revealing, unconcealment, *aletheia*, and truth-- are terms Heidegger uses to talk about being as well. In fact, this connection of revealing and truth is as old as *Being and Time* and relates closely to the phrase Levinas distances from in his writings on Celan and elsewhere, "truth of Being." Thus, technology, for Heidegger, is only one kind of revealing, which leads to a collapse of distance without offering nearness as all humans and nature become interchangeable units of resources (standing-reserve). 

This revealing that homogenizes, Heidegger calls *Gestell*. Before he introduces the term, he describes this enframing that produces the world as standing reserve as 

> The revealing that rules throughout modern technology has the character of a setting-upon, in the sense of a challenging­ forth. That challenging happens in that the energy concealed in nature is unlocked, what is unlocked is transformed, what is transformed is stored up, what is stored up is, in turn, distributed, and what is distributed is switched about ever anew (Heidegger 1977, 16).^[It is not lost on me that this description of the enframing and standing reserve at work in Heidegger's notion of the essence of technology has some incredible similarities with Lev Manovich's articulation of new media objects, particularly in their property of transcoding (Manovich 2002).]

Through this enframing or positionality (Gestell)^[See Blitz 2014 for an extended discussion of the role of QCT in the Bremen lectures and for the difference in translation choice here between enframing and positionality to render Gestell. Blitz suggests that both are unable to contain all of the nuances of Gestell in QCT and seems to elect for a focus on the idea of "challenging."], a technological kind of unconcealing, all things, including humans, are reduced to interchangeable resources that can be leveraged as needed for efficiency and production. Even in the realm of science, according to Heidegger, technology has made nature into "standing reserve," simply a set of resources ready for use. In his own questioning of Heidegger's questions about technology, Don Ihde suggests that this idea of Technology (Ihde capitalizes Technology here to signal that we are not talking about technologies) is a "*metaphysical* perspective" for Heidegger and marks the signature of Heidegger's unique approach to these questions (Ihde 2010, 18-19). The danger, which happens to be the title of the third lecture in the Bremen series, of technology as enframing, this particular kind of revealing that is technology lies in the transformation of all things into the standing-reserve, distanceless without nearness (Heidegger 2012, 44). This collapse of distance without nearness is so engulfing that it prohibits all other forms of revealing, such as poeisis (Heidegger 1977, 33). With a turn to the poetry of Hölderlin, Heidegger offers a preliminary suggestion of art as a different kind of revealing that could interrupt the dominance of the revealing that is the essence of technology, that which enframes. 

This turn to poetry as a revealing in Heidegger's questioning of technology connects back to where we started, with Levinas reading Celan on poetry as proximity, an alternative to the truth and revealing of Being in Heidegger's system. Heidegger ends QCT with Hölderlin's "poetically dwells man upon this earth" as a hint toward a solution to the problem of modern technology (1977, 34-35). Levinas refers to the very same poetic line from Hölderlin and suggests poetry as something otherwise than the revealing that is Being, something "beyond the Being of beings," where "one touches man outside of all rootedness and domestication. Homelessness becomes the humanity of man and not his degradation in the forgottenness of Being and the triumph of technique" (Levinas 1978, 19). Poetry for Levinas is not a dwelling or an articulation of nearness, but a language of and for proximity. 

It is not the framing of the potential problems with technology and its impact on human relationship that differentiates Heidegger from Levinas here. Both thinkers raise concern about processes or theories that commodify humans. Rather, they differ in their proposed solutions to these commodifying tendencies. Heidegger, in direct response to the technologizing of society, turns to poetry as art, which offers a different kind of unconcealing than that of technology, but an unconcealing all the same. Thus, though Heidegger is worried about the sameness of "standing reserve," his solution to the problem is a return to the horizon of being, which can be viewed as a homogeneity of a different sort. HOW IS THIS UNCONCEALING STILL AN ERADICATION OF DIFFERENCE -- Ihde MIGHT HAVE SOME HELP HERE? Recall that Introna, in his reflections on the phenomenological approach to ethics and internet communication technologies, suggests that all of the phenomenologists return to a shared horizon as the possibility for human being with the other (2011). Levinas, not taking up the problem of technology explicitly, proposes a mode of human relationship that he finds performed in Celan's poetry, which can not be reduced to mastery or appearance, but instead operates as a responsibility he calls a "language of and for proximity" (Levinas 1978, ??). 

Contextualizing the role of proximity in this way as something before and beyond the revealing that is central for Heidegger, we can begin to see two resonances of the term proximate at work in Levinas. The clearest sense of proximity is as a problematization of the distance/nearness spatial binary, where both nearness and distance are maintained in a process of "approach" that is as characterized by concealing as it is revealing. With the connection between revealing and truth in Heidegger, I can't help but also hear proximity as a suggestion of the ap*proximate* nature of encounter that is "for the other." The truth of Being as a revealing in a horizon of Being gives us access to things as they are, a mastery of sorts. Proximity, by contrast, promises the impossibility of mastery, always an approximation due to the infinite interruption of the other's demand on me.  

At this point, I need to make a few comments about the tenuous connections between proximity and the kind of space we discussed in relationship to interface in chapter 1. Cite the explicit place Levinas says that proximity can not be reduced to geographic nearness or distance and point out that this suggestion does NOT mean that proximity is not spatial, simply that proximity as a relationship of responsibility can not be reduced to typical notions of physical coincidence or contiguity. In his reflections on Celan, Levinas calls the language of his poetry a non-place...can the common distinction between space and place be helpful here, even if we do need to stay mindful of the work that proximity does to precede or ground the cultural practices that make up space. Space as a process can allow for encounter without an already established meaning....

Now, with this conversation in the background, we can take a close look at a few examples of how proximity works in Levinas's philosophical framework. 

Proximity as a different approach to human relationship than ontology or being blossoms in the last of Levinas's large phiosophical works, *Otherwise Than Being* (OTB) (1971). At the very beginning of OTB, when Levinas is introducing his terms and his argument, he lays out a skeleton for what he means by proximity as a relation of one for the other, writing,

> The present study sets out to not conceive proximity in function of being...[Alterity] figures as what is near in a proximity that counts as sociality, which "excites" by its pure and simple proximity. We have sought to analyze this relation without resorting to categories that dissimulate it, by conceiving it in terms of proximity qua saying, contact, sincerity of exposure, a saying prior to language, but without which no language, as a transmission of messages, would be possible (Levinas 1971, 16-17).

In this passage, he makes clear the relationship between saying and proximity, which points back to his early description of saying, where he writes,

> Saying is not a game. Antecedent to the verbal signs it conjugates, to the linguistic systems and the semantic glimmerings, a foreword preceding languages, it is the proximity of one to the other, the commitment of an approach, the one for the other, the very signifyingness of signification. (But is approach to be defined by commitment, and not rather commitment by approach? (Levinas OTB, 6)

YES, I NEED MORE ON SAYING HERE. Should I give a quick summary of what saying is? I need to go back and look at why Levinas begins talking about games. Interestingly, Heidegger says that language is playful and the essence of language is "the saying" (Heidegger 2012, 159-160). Very interesting that the second set of lectures included with the Bremen lectures articulate logos as saying!!! This is ridiculous. People must have written on this. Heidegger gives a fairly extended explanation of his notion of "saying" in the Freiburg lectures, p. 152-166. At first glance, this saying sounds (ha) very different from the saying in Levinas. As usual, for heidegger, saying is an appearing, a bringing-forth. This set of lectures is focus on λογος and leads to a suggestion that logos is saying, which is "a disclosive-concealing showing and pointing, a so-defined extending toward..., and a reaching back and forth" (Heidegger 2012, 160). Plenty more we could say about differences here, but need to unpack a bit more the difference unless I just PUSH TO A NOTE.

In both of these quick summaries, Levinas makes it clear that proximity and saying are not being, which unlike saying, "appears like a game" (Levinas 1971, 7). As we saw in our reading of QCT, for Heidegger, being is an unconcealing, a revealing that is truth. Both of these ways of talking about a human relating otherwise than being, saying and proximity, highlight a process of contact that is not reducible to appearance, or language, or truth. This is why I talk of proximity as contact without grasp, a relationship of interaction ("sociality" as Levinas says) that is not governed by understanding or an already determined set of categories. Here, proximity as a process of approach, even an "anarchic provocation," creates a space where being and meaning are possible, but only probabilistically as we saw in Drucker's concept of book as interface. Levinas beautifully resists the binary tendency to eradicate being with proximity by going further to suggest that proximity actually offers being its potential for meaning (Levinas 1971, 17). Instead of replacing being, proximity as approach is offered as something that precedes the systematic appearance that being connotes. In this sense, proximity is interface, a space of interaction that supports difference. At the risk of sounding overly simplistic and of reverting to unhelpful binaries, I imagine both interface and proximity as relationship that is irreducible to consumption.  

Levinas pushes his discussion of being and proximity toward their relationship with meaning making. He continues to emphasize the antecedence of proximity before both cognition and being, writing, "Being and cognition together signify in the proximity of the other and in a certain modality of my responsibility for the other, this response preceding any question, this saying before the said" (Levinas 1971, 27). Proximity provides the possibility of meaning via being and cognition. "This response preceding any question" counters the elevated role of questioning we saw proposed by Heidegger in QCT. Questioning signals the agency of an autonomous subject to interrogate the appearance of a being to know it in truth. Here, proximity, a process of encounter that demands a response, sets the stage for the possibility of being and knowledge. Moving even further into the realm of information and communication, Levinas again resists reduction to the cognitive, suggesting, "The plot of proximity and communication is not a modality of cognition. The unblocking of communication, irreducible to the circulation of information which presupposes it, is accomplished in saying" (1971, 49).^[Levinas reiterates this disconnection between proximity and cognition later in his discussion of sensibility and proximity (1971, 64). Another way we could state the relationship that is proximity is a contact not governed by cognition.] Drucker's suggestion that interface is a provocation to cognition shares this sentiment that some kind of encounter precedes the possibility of cognition (2011, ??).

I am not sure what to do with this yet, but here is a connection between sensibility, materiality and proximity - 

> The immediacy of the sensibility is the for-the-other of one's own materiality; it is the immediacy or the proximity of the other. The proximity of the other is the immediate opening up for the other of the immediacy of enjoyment, the immediacy of taste, materialization of matter, altered by the immediacy of contact (Levinas 1971, 75).

And another very juicy one on materiality and proximity

> The proximity of beings of flesh and blood is not their presence "in flesh and bone," is not the fact that they take form for a look, present an exte- rior, quiddities, forms, give images, which the eye absorbs (and whose alterity the hand that touches or holds, suspends easily or lightly, annulling it by the simple grasp, as though no one contested this appropriation.) (Levinas 1971, 79). 

This is a brilliant articulation of proximity as contact without grasp that is not a product (or function) of presence "in flesh and bone" or dependent on any kind of revealing. Proximity is about a relationship, but one of responsibility not revelation, approach not appearance.

In a radical moment of clarity as Levinas undertakes a fuller explication of what he means by "saying," he writes, "Proximity is quite distinct from every other relationship, and has to be conceived as a responsibility for the other; it might be called humanity, or subjectivity, or self" (1971, 47). To paraphrase, proximity is relationship founded in responsibility for the other, which can be called subjectivity. The difficult part here is to fathom this responsibility as preceding intention or will. I do not choose to be responsible for the other encountered. Proximity is not simply a nearness or even a distance, but a process of approach that demands a response, which grounds the possibility for humanity. Because of the typical spatial conception of proximity, which involves "contiguity or even coincidence," Levinas devotes an entire section to the question of proximity and space. He is clear that his use of proximity does not denote a state of relative spatial nearness or distance. Instead, proximity is a process of relating or perhaps a character of relationship governed not by sight or knowledge or understanding, but simply by approach. He writes,

> Proximity is the subject that approaches and consequently constitutes a relationship in which I participate as a term, but where 1 am more, or less, than a term. This surplus or this lack throws me outside of the objectivity characteristic of relations. Does relationship here become religion (Levinas 1971, 83)?[^religion]

Though he uses the term subject here, much like Drucker does in her analysis of interface, we could replace subject with user to resist the tendency to imagine a relationship that is governed either by the objectivity he mentions or a knowing subject. Levinas himself clarifies his use of subject here, saying, "The subjectivity of the approaching subject is then preliminary, anarchic, prior to consciousness, an implication, a being caught up in fraternity" (1971, 83-84). This subjectivity is something other than the knowing and perceiving subject and the notion of a relationship of terms that can not simply be reduced to these terms hearkens back to my suggestion that an interface between user and machine is a participation of objects, or terms, that construct the space of relationship together. So, as we saw in chapter 1, if space is a process of encounter that constructs all participants along the way, proximity can be a spatiality in this sense, without being reduced to the deterministic and relative states of distance between. Much like we found in Soja's trialectic of space, Levinas pushes this idea of proximity as a relationship of terms further and suggests that proximity is both a relationship and a term (1971, 87). To suggest that proximity is both relationship and term resists the reduction of proximity as relationship to the simple intersection of terms as that which constructs and constricts the relationship. As we saw with space and interface, the process of interaction is always a term or participant in the production of the relationship. Similarly, the more or less than a term of the subject in proximity suggests a property of emergence in this approach that is probabilistic rather than determined by the simple combination of properties of participants. 

[^religion]: The closing question of this quote about proximity, "Does relationship here become religion?," resounds loudly in our context as we explore interface as a way of thinking about relationships with bible. We will return to this question when we explore bible as book of books, where we will see that Levinas answers this question with a resounding yes. The relationship of proximity does become religion for him and Jewish relationship with bible provides a quintessential performance of this proximity. So, in Levinasian philosophy, we already have a theory of reading interfaces at work in the proximity that is bible reading.  

As Levinas weaves his discussion of proximity and its relationship to saying, sensibility, and obsession as a way of imagining human subjectivity otherwise than beginning with Heidegger's being as appearing, we find at least two major characteristics emerge. First, proximity is an immediacy of contact that is not governed by sensory data. Second, proximity precedes cognition and even consciousness. Putting these two characteristics together, I summarize proximity as contact without grasp. Levinas writes, "[Proximity] is an immediacy older than the abstractness of nature. Nor is it fusion; it is contact with the other. To be in contact is neither to invest the other and annul his alterity, nor to suppress myself in the other" (1971, 87). This articulation of contact without absorbing one term into another sounds a good deal like interface as a space of relationship that supports difference. As even the early uses of interface communicated, difference is constitutive for interface and can not be eradicated without then collapsing interface. So, contact connotes interface, interaction that supports difference. "Without grasp" reinforces that this relationship of contact does not begin with knowledge or understanding and is not reducible to a deterministic aim, but instead always eludes the grasp of any participant or observer. Levinas also correlates grasp with being, consciousness, and the said, saying, "To become conscious of a being is then always for that being to be grasped across an ideality and on the basis of a said" (1971, 100). Grasp depicts the reduction of the probabilistic to the deterministic. This grasp is inevitable, but it is only possible after a contact that eludes this reduction.  

Might just want to put this in a note as to the analogy I sometimes use for proximity, which is asymptote - 

> But it is also distinguishable from the Soilen, for proximity is not a simply asymptotic approach of its "term." Its term is not an end. The more I answer the more I am responsible; the more I approach the neighbor with which I am encharged the further away I am. This debit which increases is infinity as an infinition of the infinite, as glory.34

I wonder if we could offer a modified asymptote visualization that might depict this approach that moves me further away?

Finally, we reach the heart of the matter for OTB and for proximity, Substitution. It is no surprise that Levinas begins this seminal section of OTB with a quote from Paul Celan, "Ich bin du, wenn ich ich bin."^[Kligerman offers a helpful analysis of the relationship between Celan's poetry and this portion of Levinas's philosophical explorations in *Sites of the Uncanny: Paul Celan, Specularity, and the Visual Arts*, 2007, 65-73.] It is interesting that Levinas, writing in French, does not offer a simple and "equivalent" translation of this German line from Celan into French. In a sense, Kligernam argues that Levinas spends the rest of his section on "Substitution" translating this poetic verse (2007, 66-67). I am compelled by Klingerman's suggestion, but I also see a kind of performance of proximity in the omission of a direct translation of the poetic line. Both the French and the English reader/user are presented with a moment of encounter that interrupts the flow of language as appearing. This reminds us of how we began our explorations of proximity in Levinas as a response to the unconcealing "truth of Being" in Heidegger. 

We don't learn much about proximity here that has not already been laid out in the earlier parts of his argument, but we do find some wonderful aggregations of the operations of proximity, such as,

> In starting with sensibility^[If I am going to use this quote, I have to give a fuller description of sensibility in Levinas.] interpreted not as a knowing but as proximity, in seeking in language contact and sensibility, behind the circulation of information it becomes, we have endeavored to describe subjectivity as irreducible to consciousness and thematization. Proximity appears as the relationship with the other, who cannot be resolved into "images" or be exposed in a theme. It is the relationship with what is not disproportionate to the dpxrj in thematization, but incommensurable with it, with what does not derive its identity from the kerygmatic logos, and blocks all schematism (Levinas 1971, 101).  

This passage offers us a way to summarize what we have learned about proximity and prepares us for a move toward anarchy, which is where we began this chapter, wondering about the possibility of interface design that could afford anarchy. Right in the middle of this passage, Levinas makes a fairly straightforward case for proximity as a kind of interface. He writes, "Proximity appears as the relationship with the other, who cannot be resolved into 'images' or be exposed in a theme" (Levinas 1971, 101). As we discussed in chapter one, interface is a space of interaction that demands difference. Proximity is a relationship with the other, not simply an articulation of nearness or distance or just a theory of subjectivity or the subject, but a relationship of encounter. This relationship is with an other term that can not be resolved or exposed, thus demanding a kind of interaction that can not be reduced to sight, knowledge, or even language. Though my main focus on interface theory has been on human relationship with machine in the computing realm, proximity as human-human sociality, relationship with an other that demands responsibility and does not allow the eradication of difference fits our theory of interface quite well. I have no need for a direct or total equivalence between proximity and interface, since they operate primarily in different realms. It would be enough to have this proximity as humanness inform our theoretical framing of interface in the process of design. Yet, as we saw in Levinas's reflections on Celan's poetry, it is possible to imagine poetry as a "language of and for proximity." Is it too much to ask to imagine a kind of interface that is a space of and for proximity? This is the difficult task I have taken upon here. 

This connection of proximity and interface also helps us think about the layers of relationship, interaction, or encounter involved in today's media interfaces. Often times, when we interface with the internet or our mobile devices, we are interfacing with a machine that is affording us interaction with another human or humans. In a sense then, proximity as a human-human interface bound by responsibility could be embedded in multiple user-machine interfaces. In fact, if we pushed this further, we would find a proliferation of potential interfaces. It seems that there is a multidirectional influence possible in this process, where the responsibility characterizing (better haunting) the proximity of human-human encounter could shape the design of user-machine interfaces and these interface designs could facilitate proximity in these media that afford human interface beyond the "flesh and bone." Dare we call this interaction between interfaces an interface in itself? 

In the context of internet communication technologies and interface design in the realm of computing, there are a few other important points to mention here that emerge in this long passage quoted from the Substitution section of OTB. First, it is important to remember that Levinas offers proximity as an alternative subjectivity ("otherwise than being") to that which operates in the majority of the Western philosophical tradition. He says it again here, when he links sensibility to proximity as something exceeding/preceding knowing. This proximity is a "subjectivity irreducible to consciousness or thematization" (Levinas 1971, 101). Since we introduced Drucker's humanities approach to interface theory in the previous chapter, we have been exploring^[I initially used the word "questioning" here, but it immediately reminded me of the Heideggerian approach to being that foregrounds questions as different than Levinas's privileging of response(ibility).] the role of subjectivity in interface. Drucker offers a constructivist notion of subjectivity, where subject is made in the process of interaction with other participants in a space of encounter. Proximity has offered us another approach (pun intended) to subjectivity in interface, where the human is not simply one participant in the relationship of interaction that is interface, but the human is the condition of this interaction, which is responsibility, the one for the other. 

Back to the hints toward media in this quote from the heart of OTB in the Substitution section. Levinas suggests that in language, there is a contact that is "behind the circulation of information it becomes" (1971, 101). This sounds a good deal like the relationship between the saying and the said in Levinas. As we have seen, the saying indefinitely becomes the said when brought into the demands of language and communication. I take "circulation of information" to be a synonym for the said. So, proximity and contact are "behind" the said, such that the interaction bound by responsibility grounds any possibility of the simple flow of information that language affords. Here, I hear a philosophical resonance with Drucker's questioning of the mechanistic and deterministic notions of interface in the software world. If we think of interface as simply the circulation or presentation of information to a user, who has a set defined and static characteristics, then interface can be overdetermined and consumptive. If interface is the process of encounter that creates the possibility of circulation of information by enabling a relationship of responsibility, then we have the potential for a probabilistic space of encounter that demands difference. As proximity, interface is not simply the circulation of information, but it is the process of constructing information along the way in an ongoing interaction between the materialities of technology and user.

Perhaps the more interesting mention Levinas offers in this passage is the quoted "images" of "Proximity appears as the relationship with the other, who cannot be resolved into 'images' or be exposed in a theme (1971, 101). On a first read, this is simply a restatement of the fact that proximity for Levinas operates as a relationality that can not be reduced to sight or knowledge, both of which require a sameness. Proximity in a Levinasian sense offers us a theory of subjectivity that is always already embedded in interface, a relationship of responsibility that demands difference. This proximity demands a materiality, but can not be reduced to a spatial or temporal contiguity or coincidence or flesh and bone. Thus, proximity as a relationship is possible on the ground and online, undermining the tendency toward a thin correlation of "face to face" with one particular mediation of human relationship of bodies in a room together. Perhaps, on the ground interface actually poses more difficulty for proximity given our tendency to allow senses like sight to reign. 

Levinas goes on to say this of proximity, "Here what is essential is a refusal to allow oneself^[This seems like a slippage of language. At the level of the ethical relation as proximity in Levinas, there is no allowing oneself] to be tamed or domesticated by a theme...Proximity is thus anarchical, a relationship with a singularity without the mediation of any principle, any ideality" (1971, 101). Here we find a restatement of the earlier resistance to the kerygmatic logos as the ground of subjectivity and human sociality. The connection between kerygmatic logos and arxh is all too familiar to me given my own history of conservative evangelical biblical training. It is the anarchy of proximity that first drew me to Levinas and it is the anarchy of proximity that offers bible an afterlife in our emerging media age with its proliferation of interfaces.

## Without the Reign of an Original ##

As a student of bible for much of my life, in personal practice or scholarly pursuit, the reign of αρχη has dominated both my concept of textual tradition and any notion of manuscript awareness. The archic logocentrism of my evangelical exegetical training became immediately apparent in the first verse we learned to read in Greek - εν αρχη ην ο λογος (John 1.1). It is αρχη and all of its resonances with the *beginning* of LXX Genesis that signals the reign of λογος in a Christian interpretive tradition that claims to take the verbal character of *the* bible seriously as divine revelation. Couple this with the tenth article of the [1978 Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy](http://library.dts.edu/Pages/TL/Special/ICBI_1.pdf), which links inspiration and "the [λογος] of God" with the *original, autographic text of Scripture*, and we can see the deep archic sensibilities of the tradition in which I was reared, even at the material manuscript level.

It took David Parker's careful questioning of this αρχη or original of the manuscript tradition in [*The Living Text of the Gospels*]() to awaken me to the anarchy at work even in the materiality of bible. Yet, Parker never invokes the language of anarchy. Aware of the ancient Greek semantic potential of αρχη, Emmanuel Levinas, another close reader of biblical texts and tradition, introduced me to an anarchy that was something beyond disorder as another order and something significantly more complicated than the simple absence of a beginning or origin. In his essay titled "Substitution," Levinas takes up the relationship between proximity and the αρχη. At many points in this project, we will struggle with the potential of proximity, from spatial nearness and distance to ap-proximat-ion to a notion of contact without grasp. But for now, we will focus on the anarchic.

I wonder if a note here or a paragraph on the difference between face and facade in Levinas (Reality and it's Shadow) as it relates to interface. It is my experience that many address new media interfaces as a facade, partly indebted to the Frankfurt school's devaluation of mass media. I am arguing that interface as articulated with Drucker as a 'zone of encounter provoking probabilistic production' resembled more the face to face than it does the facade of art/media. Now that I think of it, thanks to Rothko, maybe the difference between face and facade is indeed proximity? Not simply a nearness such as Rothko's urging to stand close to his works to be enveloped in a way such that the viewer does not command the piece, but a spatiality that allows for contact without grasp. A facade invites consumption and tourism, while the face demands an encounter that can not be reduced to observation. The face as encounter has depth, which creates a space that allows for both distance and nearness, where the distance consistently interrupts the impulse to draw near (appear). Perhaps we could call this the space of the asymptotic relation? 

A facade as flat reminds me of the distinction N Katherine Hayles makes in her essay "Print is Flat, Code is Deep: The Importance of Media Specific Analysis" (Hayles 2004). 

Simon Critchley, in his work on the relationship between ethics and politics, "Infinitely Demanding," argues for a similar kind of spatiality in political anarchism. Tracing Levinas's use of anarchy in the "Substitution" section of OTB, Critchley moves from anarchy through obsession and persecution to "interstitial distance" (Critchley 2007, 121-23). For Critchley, this is already a move from the ethical to the political, with interstitial distance being a distance from AND within the state that consistently resists the tendency of the State^[I capitalize State here both to follow the convention used by Critchley and to signal the tendency of State to operate as an arche or governing principle.] to order all areas of life by collapsing the distance of multiplicity into the facade of unity (Critchley 2007, 112-13). 

When I speak of anarchy, I mean something other than a generic absence of order or a simple negation of rule, origin, or principle. Insofar as chaos is connected to the emergent properties of complex dynamic systems, I have no problem with chaos as a fecund space, loaded with potential for meaning. Yet, shaped by my encounters with the writings of Emmanuel Levinas, something deeper and more subtle is at work in my sense of the gravity of anarchy. Exploiting the koine semantic range of αρχη, which can mean beginning and reign, I hear the an-archic as that which is *without the reign of an original*.

Levinas's essay, "Substitution," has a manuscript tradition of its own that offers us an object lesson in the anarchic as "without the reign of an original." In the introduction to the first English translation of an early version of the essay, Bernasconi narrates the life of "Substitution" in [*Emmanuel Levinas: Basic Philosophical Writings*](), p. 79.

Here are three versions of a section of this essay, the french of the later iteration of the essay in *Autrement qu'être*, it's English translation by Alphonso Lingis in *Otherwise than Being*, and the English translation of the 1968 version of the essay translated by Simon Critchley, Peter Atterton, and Graham Noctor. Which is the original? Does it matter?

image 1^[Alphonso Lingis translating Emmanuel Levinas, *Otherwise than Being*, 100-101.]
image 2^[Emmanuel Levinas, *Autrement qu'être*, 158-160.]
image 3^[Critchley, Atterton, and Noctor translating Levinas, *Emmanuel Levinas: Basic Philosophical Writings*, 81]

Instead of worrying about which of these moments in the life of this essay is closest to some originary articulation of these ideas from Levinas in his 1967 lecture, can we read them together, an-archically, "as disequilibrium, as delirium, undoing thematization, eluding *principle*, origin, and will, or αρχη...*Mouvement, dans le sense originel du terme, an-archique*."

> I have intentionally created a mashup quote using bits from each of these fragments as a practice of anarchic reading. 

Isn't it interesting that a discussion of the anarchic as eluding or escaping origin points to *le sense originel du terme*? In a way, this contradiction, using the *original* sense of the word an-arche to articulate a methodology that does not privilege an origin or principle, is precisely the point. As Simon Critchley notes in his collection of lectures *The Problem with Levinas*, it is important for Levinas that anarchy does not simply become another arche or simply a different kind of order (Critchley 2015, 70-73). Though Critchley tries to argue for a link between anarchy in Levinas and political anarchism in his book *Infinitely Demanding*, he makes it clear that this link is a critical extension of Levinas not found in Levinas's writings themselves. Connecting the two Greek meanings of the word arche, Critchley says, "Anarchy cannot, therefore, be a new ordering principle, a new arkhê. It cannot reign. It can only take place as the disruption of order and not a new order" (Critchley 2015, 72). In his own writing about writing books, Levinas makes this point about the necessary difficulty or "fine risk" of writing about anarchy. He says, "Language is nevertheless able to speak of it [the very enigmatic anarchy which is the face], thereby confirming the impossibility of the an-archic constituting itself as a sovereignty, whence the very noncondition of anarchy. Yet the hold of language over the anarchic is not a mastery, for otherwise anarchy would be subordinated to the arche of consciousness" (Levinas, "Substitution," Basic Philosophical Writings, 91 note 34). 

> There is another place where he defends his writing of books in light of avoiding anarchy becoming an arche. Note 19 on p 195-6 of OTB is in the direction, but not quite what I remember. this note may be another iteration of the note from the earlier version of Substitution cited above. I wonder if it would be instructive to reflect also on his famous quote about books here?

>that I am also struck by the potential poetic movement of *délire de lire* in our exploration of the cultural production of bible.

Despite the semantic negation built into the word an-archy, I am uninterested in arguing for the absence of original. In my early attempts to articulate this anarchy in the realm of translation studies through a talk titled "From Murder to Anarchy" at the Nida School of Translation Studies 2014, I fear I had fallen into the trap of archaizing the anarchic by arguing for the eradication of the notion of original in the process of translation. The conversations with translators who have spent their lives caring for and working with both biblical and literary texts taught me that we needn't eschew the presence, value, and operation of an original or source text in the process of translation in order to question said original's governance over the validity or even methodology of a translation. We can always construct an original given a particular data set and time frame. Instead of eradicating any notion of original, I am asking us to consider a kind of reading, a mode of making, that operates *without the reign of an original*. In this vein, anarchy becomes one mechanism for the probabilistic production offered by interfaces that we discussed in chapter 1.

## Anarchic Readings ##

### Walter Benjamin - Literary Montage) ###

Walter Benjamin is well know for struggling with a major technological transition from manual to mechanical reproduction of art as the world embarked on its Second World War. In "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (Benjamin 1936), Benjamin seems to lament the loss of "aura" in a work of art when mechanically reproduced by film in particular. This notion of aura in Benjamin is notoriously complicated, but at the risk of oversimplification, we can see how aura operates as an origin or originating principle for Benjamin as he reflects on the value and production of art. For Benjamin, there seems to be a loss of aura in the new technological age of mechanical reproduction, and though not entirely clear, we can find a somewhat mournful tone in his discussion of this loss. ^[Find a few secondary sources like Brent plate and a media theorist, who offer discussions of the operation of aura in Benjamin.]

In his later work, which actually never gets "finished" in a format familiar to scholars, Benjamin seems to embrace a productive process that bothers the reign of originating principle such as intent or aura. *The Arcades Project* follows a methodology Benjamin calls "literary montage," which he describes as "" (Benjamin 1940??). As plate suggests, this methodology is not just a compositional strategy but an attempt to reimagine history anarchically, history not governed by the tyranny of a return to origins. *Arcades project* performs this methodology beautifully, resisting the need to order artifacts according to an authorial intent that would guide the reader in their appropriate consumption of the content. Instead, *Arcades Project* offers an interfAce, a zone of encounter, that affords anarchy by allowing the reader to encounter artifacts without governing their grasp.

### Michel De Certeau - Never a Blank Page ###

### Parker - Living Text of Gospels ###

Being formed in my teen age and early adult years by evangelical christian culture, the committment to original intent and original manuscript autographs as the arbitrer of meaning was deeply ingrained. The possibility of bible as simulacrum or as anything other than the witness to the originary divine revelation made no sense in this culture. If this doxa was questioned within my evangelical community, it was met with a socially acceptable means of excommunication. In an early doctoral seminar on paleography and text criticism, I was exposed to David Parker's book, The Living Text of the Gospels. Parker was one of the first serious textualists to challenge my notion of original as the "real" or as the metanarrative legitimating meaning as we read these texts. In general, Parker uses variation within the manuscript tradition of early christian texts that would come to make up what we call the bible today, particularly gospel manuscripts, to suggest that gospels are a tradition, not a law. During an analysis of variations in manuscripts regarding Jesus's comments on marriage and divorce, Parker says, "The quest for a Law in the teachings of Jesus cannot be pursued in the face "of the evidence that, for those early Christians who passed the tradition to "us, there was--no law, but a tradition whose meaning had to be kept alive by "reflection and reinterpretation (Parker, Living Text, 93).

Parker suggests that with the gospel tradition, meaning is practiced, not dictated by or excavated from an original. In his own nod to a preference for genealogy over archaeology, relationship over lineage, Parker suggests,

> The attempt to discern earlier forms of a text , from which those known to us are descended, is an essential task in the critical study of Christian origins. It does not follow that it is also necessary to recover a single original text (Parker, Living Text, 208).

Though I find his idea of the study of Christian origins a bit ironic in the context of his anarchic notion of the biblical tradition, I admire his willingness to question the doxa of the original text while still holding a deep sense of meaning possibilities in the gospel tradition. He helped open a world for me. He altered my habitus by offering a new set of possibilities to shape my dispositions, by begging questions i couldn't even yet imagine.

Taking a very different approach, Tim Beal in *The Rise and Fall of the Bible*, also raises some questions that challenge the cultural notions of bible and book. Driven in part by a curiosity around the continued rise in bible production and sales alongside what seems to be a decline in biblical literacy in America (QUOTE), Beal questions our typical ingrained notions of the relationship between literary production and consumption. He suggests that the meaning and value of the bible in America may have little to do with the accessibility and relevance of the texts inside these books that carry on the ancient manuscript tradition. Instead, it is the cultural iconicity of the bible that generates its value and meaning. Perhaps this cultural iconicity is akin to the reality principle that Baudrillard talks about in Disneyland? People buy bibles not because they actually think they will find some original meaning in these ancient texts that will be relevant to their contemporary life, but because the cultural idea of bible offers a promise that "truth" or "reality" still exist. 

No doubt, Beal is on to something when he suggests that this cultural idea of bible as a locus of singular and univocal truth is bound up in the codex technologies that came to hold in one volume the entire libraries that constituted the various community collections that were called scrolls but came to be know as bible (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location, 2032-46). In so far as this cultural idea of bible prevails, the bible as stable truth or "the real," the cultural value of the bible is married to the the cultural vlaue placed on the codex. Yet, the codex is losing its grip on the reality principle with the advent of e-books, cloud collections, and searchability that gives us new "books" made up of fragments from many sources and with little regard for their location in their "original" narratives. How will the cultural iconicity of the bible fare in this new marketplace?

Like Parker, Beal too problematizes the dominant conception of the bible as a singular book with a stable original. Interestingly, both authors make this argument using the cultural capital valued in the bible context, antiquity, which can easily slide into a sense of recovering an original. Nonetheless, Beal describes the early manuscript tradition of the bible as a collection of texts from many sources and many contexts that "were not the same from copy to copy. There was no beginning and no end to them, no first and last page. They did not have one author or one voice. They were not read in a linear way, but they were read around in. And they grew through interpretation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2046). Beal offers this imagination of the bible as a multivocal, polyvalent and dynamic library to challenge the doxa of the bible as "the literal Word of God and closed book of answers" (Beal, Rise and Fall, 2032). Just before this quote, Beal suggests that this cultural imagination of bible as reality principle is already dead, so he goes on to articulate an alternative imagination of the bible as "a space that hosts accidental revelation" (Beal, Rise and Fall, Kindle location 2060), an infinite cycle of production littered with intrigue and surprise as meaning is made in practice.
