The durability of these assumptions about reading as a private and singular act can be seen in the romanticism of reading the classics in Nicholas Carr's critique of the internet, *The Shallows*. I'd like to offer both Gamble and Nicholas Carr as examples of my own process of questioning the cultural assumptions of reading. 

 

The face is many things in Levinas's writings. The face is vulnerable, in need, demanding, etc. (Levinas Ethics and infinity, ??). In the ethical encounter^[It is not a coincidence that we share encounter language here with face and in our definition of interface as a zone of encounter.], the face is that which cannot be consumed. Stated another way, we can imagine face as an interface that creates a zone of encounter which resists mechanistic consumption and provokes probabilistic production. Face is an interface that affords proximity which shapes a disposition toward anarchy. In this way, even if Levinas resists the idea of things having a face or being the face, we can imagine book and bible as an interface that affords proximity which shapes a disposition toward anarchy.

I will begin with a look at the role of anarchy as challenging the reign of an origin or principle in Levinas. Then I will trace the connection between anarchy and proximity. Finally, we will explore the ways in which proximity as contact without grasp offers a mode of probabilistic production in the practice of reading, thus how proximity can shape our interface design.

Anarchy is a loaded term and can mean many things. Contrary to some initial impressions of both my work and my person, I am not the least interested in a simple notion of anarchy as chaos or disorder. Along the lines of Levinas, I exploit the variability of the semantic range of αρχη in Greek and use an-archic to denote a practice of meaning making without recourse to the *reign* of an *original* (See Simon Critchley with Peter Atterton and Graham Noctor translating Levinas, [*Basic Philosophical Writings*](http://amzn.com/0253210798), 81). Levinasian proximity as an anarchic encounter with the face of the other will offer questions toward the role of bible in shaping nonconsumptive (ethical) reading practices.

### proximity: encounter without grasp (proximity in Levinas) texts/books are
not anarchic, but interfaces can afford anarchy in reading practices - anarchy is afforded in an encounter, not a property, thus the important of proximity

I would like to move from probabilistic production to anarchy to proximity as a reading methodology demonstrated by Levinas in his Talmudic readings. Let us not lose sight of our focus here as we delve into the complicated weavings of Levinas's writing and thinking. My question is about the particular relationship between anarchy and proximity in Levinas's writings as it might influence reading interfaces. It is a coincidence that interface contains the word face, a critical material sign used by Levinas to imagine the anarchy of proximity. I also do not take for granted that Levinas's own reading practices and much of his philosophical thought emerge in his encounter with bible through his Jewish tradition.

As I mentioned earlier, the term "interface" has the potential to disrupt the binaries between both the virtual and real and the what and the how of reading practice. One of the most important operations of thirding for Soja is to challenge any form of cultural inquiry that reduces to binaries. He says, 

> In this critical thirding, the original binary choice is not dismissed entirely but is subjected to a creative process of *restructuring* that draws selectively and strategically from the two opposing categories to open new alternatives (Soja 1996, 5).

> The flow of time in which, according to the Kantian schema, the world is constituted is without origin. This world that has lost its principle, an-archical, a world of phenomena, does not answer to the quest for the true; it suffices for enjoyment, which is self-sufficiency itself, nowise disturbed by the evasion that exteriority opposes to the quest for the true. (Levinas 1969, 65)

> The master, the coinciding of the teaching and the teacher, is not in turn a fact among others. The present of the manifestation of the master who teaches overcomes the anarchy of facts.
We must not say that language conditions consciousness, under the pre- text that it provides self-consciousness with an incarnation in the objec- tive work language would be (as the Hegelians would say). The exteriority that language, the relation with the Other, delineates is unlike the exteriority of a work, for the objective exteriority of works is already situated in the world established by language—by transcendence.
(Levinas 1969, 69-70)

> But a world absolutely silent that would not come to us from the word, be it mendacious, would be an-archic, without principle, without a beginning. Thought would strike nothing substantial. On first contact the phenomenon would degrade into appearance and in this sense would remain in equivocation, under suspicion of an evil genius...The silent world is a world that comes to us from the Other, be he an evil genius...The evil genius' lie is not an utterance opposed to the veridical word; it is in that interspace between the illusory and the serious in which a subject who doubts breathes.
(Levinas 1969, 90-91)

> Thus the silent world would be an-archic. Knowing could not com- mence in it. But already as an-archic, at the limit of non-sense, its presence to consciousness lies in its expectation for a word that does not come. Thus it appears within a relation with the Other, as the sign the Other delivers, even if he dissimulates his face, that is, declines the assistance he would have to bring to the signs he delivers, and which he delivers, consequently, in equivocation.
(Levinas 1969, 93-94)

> The commencement of knowing is itself possible only if the bewitch- ment and the permanent equivocation of a world in which every ap- parition is a possible dissimulation, where commencement is wanting, is dispelled. Speech introduces a principle into this anarchy. Speech dis- enchants, for the speaking being guarantees his own apparition and comes to the assistance of himself, attends his own manifestation.
(Levinas 1969, 98)

> The presence of the Other dispels the anarchic sorcery of the facts: the world becomes an object. To be an object, to be a theme, is to be what I can speak of with someone who has broken through the screen of phenomena and has associated me with himself.
(Levinas 1969, 99)

> It takes place in the dimension of absolute desire by which the same is in relation with an other that was not simply lost by the same. We are not required to take contact or vision to be the archetypal gestures of straightforwardness. The Other is neither initially nor ultimately what we grasp or what we thematize. For truth is neither in seeing nor in grasping, which are modes of enjoyment, sensibility, and possession;
(Levinas 1969, 172)

> The notion of independence must be grasped elsewhere than in causality. Independence would not be equivalent to the idea of causa sui, which, moreover, is belied by birth, non-chosen and impossible to choose (the great drama of contemporary thought), which situates the will in an anarchic world, that is, a world without origin.
(Levinas 1969, 223)

> To be infinitely—infinition—means to exist without limits, and thus in the form of an origin, a commencement, that is, again, as an existent. The absolute indetermination of the there is, an existing without exis-tants, is an incessant negation, to an infinite degree, consequently an infinite limitation. Against the anarchy of the there is the existent is produced, a subject of what can happen, an origin and commencement, a power. Unless the origin had its identity of itself infinition would not be possible.
(Levinas 1969, 280)

> The will of the I affirms itself as infinite (that is, free), and as limited, as subordinated. It does not get its limits from the proximity of the other, who, being transcendent, does not define it. The I's form no totality; there exists no privileged plane where these I's could be grasped in their principle. There is an anarchy essential to multiplicity.
(Levinas 1969, 294)
