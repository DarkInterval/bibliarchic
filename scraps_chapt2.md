Saying offers a more accessible (pun intended) way to get at the operation of proximity in both Levinas and in my theory of interface. Hand quotes Levinas saying - "Saying is 'the commitment of an approach, the one for the other, the very signifyingness of signication, prior to being a communication in which a truth is manifested" (Hand Reader, 6). Already, we can see the entanglement of proximity and language in this connection with the saying...

Once this notion of technology as revealing, one mode of revealing that is being, is established, Heidegger moves toward a discussion of the nature of this kind of revealing as Gestell, which is where he returns to the concern about the collapse of distance without the encouragement of nearnesss that he began the lecture series with.

** Need to at least mention the more recent work by Silverstone on Proper Distance
-- need to reflect on the use of proper here as dangerous similarity to the notion of proper De Certeau reflects on in his notions of reading as anarchy. 
-- Silverstone is very clear about his choice of proper as a term, so I can work from there. 
-- Mostly, though it is useful to point out that the concerns about nearness and distance are still occupying our discourse on human-computer interface. 
-- Though I appreciate the difficult task Silverstone undertakes, I have several concerns about the use of proper, his reading of proximity in Levinas, and the absence of Heidegger in the discussion.

In my first course on Levinas, I ran across an article by Richard A. Cohen dealing explicitly with the relationship between Levinasian ideas and the emerging technological landscape of the internet and virtual reality (Cohen 2000). My discomfort with the approach taken by all three theorists in the article, Cohen, Introna, and Turkle, pushed me to consider carefully my own perspectives on the potential for meaningful human relationship in our emerging media ecosystems.

Yet, the word 'face' has come to signify human interaction unmediated by digital technologies in the common phrase 'face to face.' There is a great deal of discussion these days about the different values of online/virtual/digital interaction and the so-called 'face to face.' For example, Sherry Turkle has become a prominent public voice in discussions of technology and its social effect, as evidenced in the impressive attention[^16] captured by her new book, *Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age*.[^17] I first encountered Turkle's work while engaging a Richard Cohen article, 'Ethics and Cybernetics: Levinasian Reflections,'[^18] in my struggle with the face to face language in online education. Using her work from 1995, *Life on the Screen*,[^19] Cohen offers Turkle as an example of media scholars who champion the advantages of cybernetics and internet communication technologies for redefining subjectivities in the direction of post-modern notions of multiplicity and instability.[^20]

Turkle's more recent work has shifted focus from this earlier celebration of the fragmented self to a serious anxiety about the effects of robotics and mobile devices on our social capacities as humans.[^21] Two minutes into a 2015 NPR interview titled 'Making the Case For Face to Face in an Era of Digital Conversation,'[^22] Turkle suggests that 'face to face conversation is the most human and humanizing thing that we do, it's where we learn to put ourselves in the place of the other.' For many, this phrase, 'face to face,' as Turkle uses it has come to represent 'real' human interaction as opposed to a weak simulation or even cheap imitation that happens through internet media.

Part of why the language of inter*face* compels me is because it can unsettle this binary between digital interfaces and this 'face to face' advocated by Turkle. Conversation over the coffee table and exchanges on Twitter can both be understood as interface and both are mediated by technologies if we understand language as a technology. So, this term, 'interface,' pushes beyond any digital/analog or virtual/real dichotomies and demands that we think about interface design in whatever media we find ourselves using. In a way, we could imagine 'interface,'the intersection of faces, as a useful translation of the phrase 'face to face.'
